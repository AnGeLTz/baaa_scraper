The crew decided to perform an approach to runway 24 when on final, the captain ditched the aircraft few dozen meters offshore. The impact was relatively violent and 10 occupants were killed, among them the captain. All 12 other occupants were injured, some seriously. ", "probable_cause": "The accident resulted from a series of inappropriate actions by the crew, facing a mechanical failure of an engine which alone should never have led to this outcome. Among the factors explaining this below-average performance of the crew, the inquiry committee noted:\r\n- The influence of a possible levels of alcohol of the crew members;\r\n- A lack of rigor in the type rating qualifying of the crew;\r\n- Omissions in the Operations Manual (no division of tasks in some occasional or emergency situations);\r\n- Deficiencies in the company's technical control of the state of the aircraft."}
