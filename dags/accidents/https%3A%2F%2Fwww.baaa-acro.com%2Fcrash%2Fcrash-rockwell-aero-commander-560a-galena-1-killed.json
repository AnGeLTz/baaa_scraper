On approach to Galena, the pilot encountered poor weather conditions with low ceiling, fog and snow falls reducing the visibility to 1,000 feet. On final under VFR mode, he was unable to locate the runway when he realized he was facing the tower. He initiated a turn to avoid collision when he lost control of the airplane that crashed near the runway. All five passengers were seriously injured while the pilot was killed.

The following factors were reported:\r\n- The pilot continued VFR flight into adverse weather conditions, \r\n- Evasive maneuver to avoid collision, \r\n- The pilot failed to maintain flying speed, \r\n- Low ceiling, fog and snow, \r\n- Inadequate preflight preparation, \r\n- Improperly loaded aircraft,\r\n- No weather briefing received, \r\n- Low level VFR approach to IFR airport, \r\n- Turned to avoid tower and stalled, \r\n- Passengers obtained a partial weather briefing, \r\n- Over maximum gross weight."}
