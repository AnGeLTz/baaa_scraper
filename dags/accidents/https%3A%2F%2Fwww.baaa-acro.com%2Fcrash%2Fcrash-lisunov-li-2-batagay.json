Unable to gain sufficient height, the pilot-in-command attempted an emergency landing near a river located one km from the airfield. The airplane hit trees, crash landed, lost its undercarriage and came to rest in a wooded area. While all five crew members were uninjured, the airplane was written off. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew failed to prepare the flight properly and hurried the departure. With an OAT of -48\u00b0 C., the oil was not sufficiently warm and this caused the engine to run improperly after rotation, with propellers blocked in an angle between 20\u00b0 and 30\u00b0, causing drag and impeding the plane to gain sufficient altitude. In such conditions, an emergency landing was unavoidable. "}
