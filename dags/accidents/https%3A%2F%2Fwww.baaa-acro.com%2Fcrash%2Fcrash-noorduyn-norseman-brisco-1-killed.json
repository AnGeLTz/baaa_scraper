The airplane was carrying boat equipment and its total weight was just within limits. The airplane was owned by Jim Lougheed.", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of the combination of the following factors:\r\n- The aircraft performances and capabilities were reduced due to the high OAT,\r\n- The total weight was just within limits, \r\n- The speed was too low during the last turn, causing the aircraft to stall, \r\n- Presence of strong winds.
