Few minutes later, the crew encountered atmospheric turbulences and lost control of the aircraft that crashed near Gavura, about 24 km northwest of Joinville Airport. The aircraft was destroyed and all five occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The following factors were identified:\r\n- Weather conditions were marginal with atmospheric turbulences, \r\n- Loss of control after the captain exercised poor judgment about weather conditions and demonstrated overconfidence as he was trying to beat his speed record on this leg, \r\n- Lack of administrative, technical and operational crew surveillance by the operator,\r\n- Poor crew coordination, \r\n- Excessive speed on descent, \r\n- The radiosonde from the meteorology surveillance center based in Curitiba was unserviceable."}
