The captain informed ATC about the situation and was cleared to return for an emergency landing. Unable to gain height, the airplane struck trees at a speed of 210 km/h and crashed in a wooded area located on a hilly terrain about 7,5 km from the airport. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 38 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the left engine failed slightly less than a minute after rotation due to icing. For unknown reasons, the crew failed to follow the pre-takeoff checklist and did not activate the engine deicing systems despite the fact that icing conditions were reported in altitude. During climb, the left engine failed while both engines n\u00b02 and 3 did not provide sufficient power. Also, it was determined that the total weight of the aircraft was 419 kg above MTOW  while its speed at the time the left engine failed was insufficient, also because the landing gear were not completely raised.
