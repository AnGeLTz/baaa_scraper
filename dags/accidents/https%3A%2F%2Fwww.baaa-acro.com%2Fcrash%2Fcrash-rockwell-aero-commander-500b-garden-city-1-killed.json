More than half way to Dodge City, the pilot reported engine problems to Kansas City (ARTCC). Vectors were provided to the Dodge City Airport, but the pilot did not maintain assigned headings. The aircraft headed back towards Garden City to attempt an instrument approach. Radar vectors were provided for the localizer approach. Radar indicated that the aircraft did not become stabilized on the approach. There was a significant loss of ground speed as the pilot was attempting to get established on the localizer. Radar contact was lost about 2 miles from the airport at a speed approaching stall speed for this aircraft. The aircraft crashed about 2 miles short and to the right of course. The aircraft impacted in a vertical nose down attitude on heading which indicated a turn away from the airport. The left prop was found in the feather position. No mechanical problem was discovered. The right engine appeared to be producing full power at impact. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
