After landing on runway 04, the crew started the braking procedure but the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, went through a fence, lost its undercarriage and came to rest in a rocky area, bursting into flames. All five occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was partially destroyed by a post crash fire.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who landed too far down the runway, reducing the landing distance available. The following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Excessive speed on approach (the IAS was 143 knots upon touchdown),\r\n- The crew completed the approach in a too steep descent, \r\n- Incorrect flare which caused the aircraft to land too dar down the runway, \r\n- Insufficient landing distance available, \r\n- The crew failed to initiate a go-around procedure."}
