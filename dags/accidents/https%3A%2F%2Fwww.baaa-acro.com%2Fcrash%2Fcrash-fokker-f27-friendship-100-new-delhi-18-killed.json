Few minutes later, while on a second attempt to land, the crew failed to realize his altitude was too low when the airplane struck the ground and crashed 1,600 meters short of runway threshold. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 18 occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "During the second approach, the crew decided to descend below the glide. The captain realize he was too low and initiated a go-around manoeuvre but failed to position the flaps in a correct angle, causing the aircraft to stall and to crash. The distance with ground was insufficient to expect a stall recovery. The lack of visibility caused by night remains a contributing factor."}
