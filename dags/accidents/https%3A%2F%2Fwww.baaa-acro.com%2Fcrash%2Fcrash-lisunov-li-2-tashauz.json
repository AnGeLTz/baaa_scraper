The pilot in command completed the landing and after touchdown, made an emergency brake procedure. When the aircraft came to a halt, all 16 occupants were able to evacuate the cabin and were unhurt. The aircraft burnt for about 12-14 minutes and was destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the person in charge to refuel the aircraft in Ashgabat Airport failed to properly close the left fuel tank cap. This was possible because the fuel filter was not correctly set in the fuel line. This led fuel to leak in flight and on approach, the fuel spilled along the wing root, over the wing and eventually caught fire while in contact with high temperature elements of the left engine. "}
