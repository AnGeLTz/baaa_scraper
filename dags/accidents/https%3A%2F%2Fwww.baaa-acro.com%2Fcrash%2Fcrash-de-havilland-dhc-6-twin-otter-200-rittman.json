Following several successful flights with and without passengers, the pilots discussed single engine operations, and the first pilot reduced the right engine's power to flight idle and feathered the propeller. During the final leg of the approach to landing, the airplane crossed over a fence near the runway threshold, and the first pilot pitched the airplane downward. The nose landing gear contacted the runway \"hard,\" and the airplane began to bounce. After several bounces, the first pilot elected to abort the landing, increased power on the left engine to \"full.\" As the first pilot pitched the airplane upward, it yawed to the right, \"stalled,\" and impacted the ground.\n", "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper flare and recovery from a bounced landing, which resulted in a stall and subsequent impact with the ground."}
