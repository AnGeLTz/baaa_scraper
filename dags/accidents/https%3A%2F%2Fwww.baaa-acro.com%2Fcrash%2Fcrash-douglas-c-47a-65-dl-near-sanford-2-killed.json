The aircraft left Fayetteville-Pope AFB at the end of the evening and while cruising at an altitude of some 5,000 feet, the electrical system suffered technical problems while an auxiliary generator failed. The Pitot tube deicing system failed as well, so the parameters transmitted to the airspeed indicator were erroneous. In such situation, crew decided to return to Fayetteville and while flying across the last cloud layer, the crew did not realize his altitude was insufficient due to poor visibility. The aircraft hit a mountain slope and was totally wrecked some 14 km west of Sanford. Both crew members were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nTheodore Cole   1.", "probable_cause": null}
