Short of next reporting point Kadas, the aircraft was about 10 miles right of track for which the permission was obtained and the pilot requested for a direct routing to Kanpur. About 10 minutes later, at an altitude of 14,000 feet, while cruising in bad weather conditions, the twin engine aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent, partially disintegrated in the air and eventually crashed in an open field near Mainpuri. All eight occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "While in cruising altitude, the crew encountered severe updrafts while flying in thunderstorm activity. Following a possible abrupt and abnormal manoeuvre, the crew lost control of the airplane that entered a spiral dive, resulting in an in-flight break up due to aerodynamic overload, leading to a total loss of control followed with a heavy impact with the ground.
