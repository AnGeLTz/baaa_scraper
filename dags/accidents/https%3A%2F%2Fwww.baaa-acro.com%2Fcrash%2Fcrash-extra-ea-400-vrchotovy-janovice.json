About 15 minutes into the flight, while cruising in good weather conditions, he encountered engine problems and elected to divert to Bene\u0161ov Airfield. Shortly later, some cooling liquid leaked from the engine into the cabin and on the windshield, reducing the pilot's vision. He elected to make an emergency landing in a cornfield when, upon touchdown, the aircraft crashed and came to rest upside down with its right wing torn off. There was no fire. The pilot was injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the plane crash was a leak of coolant from the space of cylinder n\u00b05. The leaked coolant penetrated into the cabin where it splashed the windshield. This made it impossible for the pilot to look ahead. For this reason, the pilot was forced to make an emergency landing."}
