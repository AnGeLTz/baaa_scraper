At an excessive speed of 150 knots, the four engine airplane landed about 800-900 meters down the runway 15L, on a wet surface. The crew failed to use all available braking systems and unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran at a speed of 40 knots, went through a perimeter fence and descended a ravine before coming to rest in flames. 20 passengers were injured while 120 other occupants escaped uninjured. Unfortunately, 14 passengers were killed. The aircraft was totally destroyed by a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of a succession of errors on part of the flying crew, among them:\r\n- The aircraft was unstable on final approach, \r\n- The crew landed too far down the runway with a touchdown point estimated 800 to 900 meters past the runway threshold, \r\n- The aircraft's speed at touchdown was excessive (150 knots),\r\n- The crew failed to apply brakes according to published procedures, especially the wheel brakes in known adverse weather conditions, \r\n- Wrong approach configuration, \r\n- The crew has been informed prior to landing that the braking coefficient was medium to poor,\r\n- The runway surface was wet due to recent rain falls.
