After stabilizing, the approach \"was normal.\" At decision altitude, the pilot indicated that he could see the approach lights and the runway, but was not in a position to land so he executed a missed approach. After being vectored around for another approach, he stated that he was on the localizer but was \"high\" on the glide slope. After giving \"a little\" nose down pitch, he became distracted when the autopilot became \"accidentally disengaged.\" The pilot stated that he \"inadvertently descended through the glide slope and impacted the ground short of the runway.\" He further stated that the \"first indication\" that he was low was when the aircraft \"struck the ground.\" The aircraft was destroyed on impact. A facility check conducted by the FAA of the ILS found all parameters within normal specifications.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain the proper glidepath during the instrument approach. Contributing factors were the dark night light conditions and the pilot's diverted attention."}
