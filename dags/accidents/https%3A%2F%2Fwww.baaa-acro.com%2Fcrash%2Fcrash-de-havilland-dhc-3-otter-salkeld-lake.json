The pilot, after intentionally planning to land as close to the end of the lake as possible, overshot the selected landing area. In an attempted go-around, the aircraft could not out-climb the rising terrain. A tailwind condition prevailed at the time and the Otter was five hundred pounds over gross weight. It collided with the trees, crashed and burned, seriously injuring the two on board.\r\nSource: http://www.dhc-3archive.com/DHC-3_375.html and Karl E. Hayes.", "probable_cause": null}
