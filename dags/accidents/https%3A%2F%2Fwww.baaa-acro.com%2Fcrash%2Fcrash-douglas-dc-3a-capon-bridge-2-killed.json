Witnesses in an nearby observation aircraft reported the DC-3 entered a gradual climb, which continued until the DC-3 was in a steep nose high attitude. The pilot of the observation aircraft tried to communicate with the DC-3 pilots, but could not make radio contact. The observation pilot reported the DC-3 entered a stall/spin at about 1,200 feet agl, then crashed. An investigation revealed no evidence of a preimpact failure. The DC-3 was not equipped with a wire cutter kit. Both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Inadequate visual lookout by the pilots of the DC-3, which resulted in their failure to see-and-avoid the powerlines. Factors related to the accident were: the obstruction (transmission wires), and the lack of visual cues for the pilots."}
