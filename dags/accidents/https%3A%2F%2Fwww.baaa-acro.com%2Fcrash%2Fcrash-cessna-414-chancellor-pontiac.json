Attempts to restart the engine were not successful. While the pilot was attempting a restart, the aircraft drifted to the right of the runway centerline and toward the proximity of hangars. The pilot stated that due to the power loss and wind conditions, he elected to land on airport property. Gear extension was delayed until just before landing. The aircraft touched down before the right main landing gear was fully extended and locked. Subsequently, the right main gear collapsed and the aircraft skidded about 500 feet before coming to rest. An examination revealed the nacelle and main fuel tanks were empty, but fuel was still remaining in the auxiliary tanks.
