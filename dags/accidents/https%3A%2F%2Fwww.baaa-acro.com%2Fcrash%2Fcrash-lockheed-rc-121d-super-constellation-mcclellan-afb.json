Shortly after takeoff from runway 16, while climbing to an altitude of 500 feet, the engine number two caught fire. The crew obtained the authorization to return for an emergency landing and the captain completed a 180 turn to intercept the glide. Doing so, the airplane lost 200 feet while flying over a populated area and the speed dropped to 120 knots. On final, the captain told his colleagues he was unable to reach the airport so he attempted an emergency landing in an open field located 1,5 mile short of runway 16. On touchdown, the airplane slid for several yards, lost its right wing and came to rest in flames. All 18 occupants were injured, five of them seriously, and the aircraft was destroyed by fire.
