After it took off, the ATC controller noted that it was climbing slower than expected. After climbing to about 4,200 feet msl, the aircrew reported a problem with the left engine and said they did not believe they could make it back to the departure airport. They expressed a desire to continue toward the southwest. ATC proceeded to vector them to the Weston Airport, but informed them that it had no instrument approach. After the reported engine malfunction, ATC personnel noted that the aircraft continued in a gradual left turn. About 8 minutes after takeoff, radio contact was lost. A witness on the ground saw the aircraft come over a hill with the sound of an engine at high power. At about that time, the aircraft collided with a power line cable, then crashed into two trees, impacted the ground and burned. An examination of the wreckage revealed no significant preimpact failures. The aircraft was estimated to be approximately 400 lbs over its max certificated gross weight. All four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power\r\nPhase of operation: climb - to cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
