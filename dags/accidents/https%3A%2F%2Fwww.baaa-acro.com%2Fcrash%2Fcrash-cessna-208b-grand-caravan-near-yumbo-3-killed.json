At 1144LT, the crew reported his altitude at 5,600 feet. Two minutes later, while cruising in poor visibility, the aircraft struck trees and crashed in wooded and hilly terrain near Yambo. The wreckage was found few hours later and all three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The following factors were identified:\r\n- Controlled flight into terrain,\r\n- Execution of a VFR flight in reduced visibility weather conditions,\r\n- Poor decision making by the crew in continuing VFR operation as they were in an environment of significantly reduced visibility,\r\n- Inadequate operational risk assessment due to the lack of familiarity of the foreign crew with the topography and meteorological evolution of the sector."}
