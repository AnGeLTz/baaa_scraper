Because the propeller was still turning he elected not to feather the left propeller. The airplane would not maintain altitude so he lowered the landing gear and ditched the airplane in a swamp. Examination of the left fuel tank revealed the fuel float valve actuators and float arms excessively worn. This condition would allow unmetered air into the fuel lines. Also noted was the condition of one of the left fuel valves that could jam open allowing the fuel pickup to unport and induce excessive air into the fuel lines. ", "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot to feather the propeller when the engine lost power, and his failure to follow the emergency procedure checklist. Contributing to the accident was the inadequate design of the fuel tank float valves which allowed for excessive wear and subsequent induction of unmetered air into the fuel lines."}
