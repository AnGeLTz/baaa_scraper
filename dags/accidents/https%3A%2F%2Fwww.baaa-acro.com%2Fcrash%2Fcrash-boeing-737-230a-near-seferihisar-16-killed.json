He was cleared to the Outer Marker (CU NDB) then for an ILS approach to runway 35. After passing the NDB, the crew switched to ILS and thus couldn't verify his position while in the procedure turn. The aircraft was outside the 35\u00b0 sector of the ILS centreline and the crew followed the wrong side beam. The aircraft descended too low and struck the slope of Mt D\u00fcmentepe (800 meters high) located about 18 km southwest of the airport. It disintegrated on impact and all 16 occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nWolfgang Hechler, pilot,\r\nHelmuth Z\u00f6ller, copilot,\r\nLothar M\u00fchlmeister, steward, \r\nSusan Epple, stewardess, \r\nSusanne Kaltenbach, stewardess.\r\nPassengers:\r\nZeki Akta\u015f, \r\nM\u00fcbeccel Can,\r\nEthem Delinaslan, \r\nNecla Demirel, \r\nT\u00fclay Yildiz,\r\nM\u00fcslim Yildiz,\r\nMustafa Azur,\r\nH\u00fcseyin Vidinli, \r\nFaruk \u015eim\u015fek, \r\nTanza Ak\u00e7if, \r\nSadri Yetmi\u015fbir. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by a wrong use of the navigation aids on part of the flying crew. The cause was attributed mainly to the lack of adherence to the company procedures, especially in respect of crew coordination during approach and basic instrument flying procedures. At the time of the accident, the terminal radar was not available. "}
