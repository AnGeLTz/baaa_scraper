The aircraft was on an IFR flight plan. The pilot stated visual contact was established at about 2,000 feet msl but ground features were masked in snow. When the pilot did not see the airport at the proper time he commenced a missed approach and the aircraft struck the ground. Investigation revealed that the obs (vor course indicator) was set on 222\u00b0 instead of 202\u00b0 for the published inbound heading. The resultant course passed directly over the accident site. The aircraft was not observed on radar because of its low alt. The pilot, sole on board, was seriously injured.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with terrain/water\r\nPhase of operation: missed approach (IFR)\r\nFindings\r\n1.
