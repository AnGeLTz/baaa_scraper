It was reported that the aircraft yawed sharply left and climbed to between 50 and 100 feet agl before it began losing altitude. The aircraft struck the ground and continued to move forward on the ground several hundred feet until it struck the airport perimeter fence. The aircraft came to rest 1,600 feet west of the runway, on a heading of 290\u00b0. A post-crash fire destroyed the cargo area of the aircraft. Examination of the left engine revealed a compressor turbine blade airfoil separation. Disassembly of the propeller on the left engine indicated that the propeller had autofeathered normally after the engine failed. The captain reportedly made the takeoff. All eight occupants were injured, two seriously. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
