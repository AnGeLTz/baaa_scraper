The aircraft descended below the glide and the left main gear struck an element of the approach light system located 100 metres short of runway threshold. The aircraft then landed 50 metres short of runway, causing both main landing gear to collapse. The aircraft slid on its belly for about 580 metres before coming to rest, bursting into flames. All 116 occupants were rescued, among them 21 were injured. The aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who led the aircraft descending below the glide in limited visibility conditions. The crew's attention was focused on the visual contact with the runway and the pilots ignored the alarms that was sounding in the cockpit."}
