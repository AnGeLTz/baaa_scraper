While cruising over The Channel, the crew encountered poor weather conditions and low visibility due to fog. The pilot reduced his altitude in an attempt to maintain a visual contact with the water surface when the aircraft crashed in unknown circumstances into the sea. As the aircraft failed to arrive in Croydon, SAR operations were initiated by British and French Authorities. Nine days later, on May 18, the dead body of a passenger was found on a beach in Fort-Mahon, Manche. Also, few debris and some mail were later recovered on several beaches of the area. The wreckage was never found. It is believed that the airplane may have crashed about 15 km north of Dieppe, Seine-Maritime. \r\nCrew: \r\nFran\u00e7ois Cannet, pilot,\r\nJoseph Ollier, radio navigator,\r\nMyles Murphy, steward.\r\nPassengers:\r\nComte de Neuville,\r\nMr. Guichard,\r\nArthur Louis Fraissard.", "probable_cause": "Due to the lack of evidences, the exact cause of the accident could not be determined.
