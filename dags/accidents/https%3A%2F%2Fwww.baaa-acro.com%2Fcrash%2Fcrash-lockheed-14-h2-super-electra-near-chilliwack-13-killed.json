SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended after few days as no trace of the aircraft nor the 13 occupants was found. The wreckage was spotted by hunters in August 1943. ", "probable_cause": "According to Canadian investigators, at the time of the accident, the aircraft was off track more than 120 km, most probably due to a general failure of the electric system. Analysis revealed that the crew did not follow the prescribed track after overflying the city of Squamish. Due to poor visibility, night, bad weather conditions and the failure of the lights, pilots were unconscious of their real position and were unable to locate the mountainous terrain on which the aircraft crashed.
