It appears that lightning struck the right wing that caught fire and later detached. As the pilot-in-command attempted to stabilize the airplane, turbulences caused a structural failure of the left wing. Out of control, the airplane dove into the ground and crashed in flames in a jungle located in a mountainous area in the region of Puerto Inca. Debris and dead bodies were found in a large area. A female passenger aged 17, Juliane Koepcke, was ejected at impact and was the only survivor. Despite her injuries (a broken collar bone, a deep gash to her right arm, a concussion and an eye injury), she walked away for 10 days and was eventually rescued by lumbermen.
