The aircraft started to deviate to the left of the runway axis while both pilots were applying brakes. After tyre n\u00b03 burst, the deviation continued until the aircraft left the paved surface of the runway and finally fell through an embankment with around 15 metres of height located at the end of runway 15. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot-in-command and other nine people suffered minor injuries. There was no fire. ", "probable_cause": "It is considered that the accident probably happened because of a combination of three factors:\r\n1. An unstable approach that resulted in a higher than normal touchdown speed.\r\n2. The inability to select propeller reverse due to the probable tripping of the circuit breaker FLIGHT IDLE SOLENOID 1 & 2 before or at touchdown.\r\n3. The cross connection of the wheel speed transducer wire harness of wheels 3 and 4, which, due to heavy braking, produced a flat spot in wheel 3 and reduced the braking capability of wheel 4."}
