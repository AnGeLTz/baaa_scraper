The Cessna T207A, N6383H, was maneuvering in left turns while conducting aerial photography, and had just initiated a turn toward the east. The left wings of each aircraft were struck by the other airplane. Witnesses indicated that about 2 seconds before impact, the PA-28 attempted to avoid a collision by beginning a climbing right turn. Each aircraft continued past the other and then both spiraled to the ground. The weather conditions were clear, visibility 3 miles in haze. Neither airplane was in radar or voice contact with any FAA facility. All three occupants in both aircraft were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The failure of both pilots to see and avoid each other. The haze was a factor."}
