After a training period of 3 hours and 14 minutes, the crew performed a low pass over runway 23 in a slight nose-up attitude. While initiating a climb, the pilot-in-command lost control of the airplane that crashed in flames near the runway end. The aircraft was destroyed and all six crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Continual increase of pitching up attitude during overshoot which lead to the stalling of the aircraft at an insufficient height for recovery. Contributing were the inaccurate calculation of the CG position before takeoff and the possibility of movement of the ballast weight aft during flight."}
