Following several 'touch-and-go' completed successfully, the crew landed and simulated an engine failure, reducing the power on the left engine. While rolling on runway 33R, flaps were mistakenly retracted from 30\u00b0 to zero prior to takeoff. Unable to rotate, the aircraft continued, overran and eventually collided with the ILS antenna. Both pilots escaped with minor injuries while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
