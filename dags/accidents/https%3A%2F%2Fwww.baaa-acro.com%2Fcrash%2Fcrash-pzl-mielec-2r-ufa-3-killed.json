Following a running distance of 250-280 meters on takeoff, the pilot-in-command started the rotation. Unable to maintain a positive rate of climb, the airplane struck tree tops, stalled and crashed upside down 78 meters further in a field, about 1,037 meters after the start of the take off run. The aircraft was destroyed and all three occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the total weight of the aircraft at takeoff was 779 kilos above the MTOW. Following a too short takeoff roll, the pilot-in-command rotated prematurely. Due to an insufficient speed, the airplane was unable to maintain a positive rate of climb and a correct climb path. "}
