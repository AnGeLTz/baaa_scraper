Five minutes after takeoff, while cruising at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the crew willingly shut down the right engine. Four minutes later, the left engine encountered technical problems and failed. Unable to maintain a safe altitude, the captain decided to attempt an emergency landing and the airplane crash landed in a field located in Effingham, about 2 miles southeast of the Wisley Airfield. While all four crew members were uninjured, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. This was the first mishap involving a Vickers Viking. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the left engine failure was certainly due to the cutting off of the fuel supply."}
