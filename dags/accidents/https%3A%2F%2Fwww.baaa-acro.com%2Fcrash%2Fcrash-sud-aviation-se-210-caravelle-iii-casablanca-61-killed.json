On final approach, the crew encountered unclear technical problems when the airplane lost height and crashed 2 km short of runway 35 threshold. The aircraft was destroyed and 61 occupants were killed while 21 other were injured. ", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the final approach was continued below the glide as a result of various problems. During the descent, the fire alarm connected to the right engine came on in the cockpit and the flight engineer immediately switched all the power of the hydraulic pumps on the engine that the captain was shutting down, which blocked the transfer actions until the power supply on the left engine would be reactivated. At impact, controls started to function again but it was too late for the pilot-in-command to expect recovery. "}
