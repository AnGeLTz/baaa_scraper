While descending to Los Rodeos Airport runway 12, weather conditions worsened and the pilot was instructed by ATC to make an approach to runway 30 via a special VFR clearance. Few minutes later, while approaching at an insufficient altitude, the aircraft collided with a house under construction and crashed in a garden. The aircraft was totally destroyed and both occupants were killed. The accident occurred in IMC conditions. ", "probable_cause": "Collision with obstacle while approaching under VFR mode in IMC conditions. The following factors were identified:\r\n- The pilot did not have sufficient experience, \r\n- Marginal weather conditions, \r\n- The pilot failed to see and avoid the obstacles and may have suffered a spatial disorientation, \r\n- Excessive workload in the cockpit during the approach associated with lack of visibility, low experience and too many radio communications on the frequency."}
