In a 3,000 metres visibility, the crew increased power on the right engine and initiated a go-around when the aircraft lost height and crashed 162 metres from the runway threshold and 477 metres to the left of its extended centerline. It slid for few dozen metres until the apron where it collided with a parked Antonov AN-24. All 23 occupants escaped uninjured while both aircraft were damaged beyond repair.
