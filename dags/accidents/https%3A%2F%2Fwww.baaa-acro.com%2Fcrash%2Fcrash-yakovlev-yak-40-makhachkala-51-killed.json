While over mountainous terrain, the crew failed to realize his altitude was insufficient when, at an altitude of 550 metres and at a speed of 366 km/h, the aircraft struck the slope of Mt Kukurtbash (980 metres high) located 23 km from the airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 51 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft was following a wrong approach path to Makhachkala-Uytash Airport following inaccurate ATC instructions. ATC in charge transmitted wrong instructions to the crew, causing the aircraft to be off course and below the minimum prescribed altitude. The crew was unable to see and avoid the mountain due to low clouds in the area and was unaware of his exact position. It was also reported that the crew allowed 47 passengers (39 adults and 8 children) to embark in Elista while 32 seats were available on board. This caused the aircraft to take off with a total weight of 260 kilos above MTOW."}
