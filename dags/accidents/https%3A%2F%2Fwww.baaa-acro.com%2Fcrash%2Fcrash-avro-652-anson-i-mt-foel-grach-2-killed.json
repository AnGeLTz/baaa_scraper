All of the crew survived the initial impact though three of them were seriously injured and were unable to leave the wrecked aircraft. Pilot Officer Archer, being the least injured, was the only man able to walk out for help. Rescuers arrived on site on January 16 around 1000LT. Sgt Brocklehurst was found lying across the navigator's table, apparently as though he had fallen asleep there and died, Sgt Barnett was in the co-pilot's seat and was also found to be dead. Sgt Paterson was alive and reported to be warm.\r\nCrew (9th AFU):\r\nP/O Kenneth Archer, pilot,\r\nSgt Eric Thomas Brocklehurst, wireless operator and air gunner, \u2020\r\nSgt William Henry Barnett, navigator, \u2020\r\nSgt Frank Paterson, navigator.\r\nSource: \r\nhttp://www.peakdistrictaircrashes.co.uk/pages/wales/waleseg110.htm", "probable_cause": null}
