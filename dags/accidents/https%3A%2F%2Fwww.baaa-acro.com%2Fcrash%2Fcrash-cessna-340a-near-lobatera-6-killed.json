All flight was completed under VFR mode but while descending to San Antonio del T\u00e1chira, weather conditions worsened and the pilot switched to IFR mode. Shortly later, control was lost and the aircraft crashed on the slope of Mt Laja, near Lobatera. The wreckage was found about 25 km northeast of San Antonio del T\u00e1chira Airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all six occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The most probable cause for the occurrence of this accident was the loss of situational awareness, caused mainly by the change of flight conditions under visual rules to flight under instrumental flight rules, due to the adverse weather conditions in which the descent phase began, so it is possible to establish the Human Factor as the cause of the accident and the Physical Factor as a contributor."}
