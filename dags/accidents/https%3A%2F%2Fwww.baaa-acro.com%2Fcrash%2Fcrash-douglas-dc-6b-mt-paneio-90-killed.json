An activ thunderstorm area was located south of the airport so the crew started an ILS approach but modified his track to the northeast over the region of Keratea. While flying at an altitude of 2,000 feet with its undercarriage retracted, the four engine aircraft passed over the city of Keratea then struck the slope of Mt Paneio located about 20 km southeast of Hellinikon Airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and none of 90 occupants survived. ", "probable_cause": "The pilots were unable to distinguish the mountain due to low visibility caused by night and poor weather conditions. While slightly off track on approach, the airplane struck a mountain slope and was destroyed. The accident is considered to be the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain. "}
