On approach to Kiev-Zhuliany Airport, while making a turn at an altitude of 250-300 meters, the aircraft collided with an Aeroflot Ilyushin II-14D registered CCCP-L1360 that was carrying four crew members on a local training mission. Investigations determined that the propeller of the right engine of L2071 struck the right wing of the L1360, proving that both airplanes were facing each other. Following the collision, L1360 lost its right wing, dove into the ground and crashed while L2071 lost its right propeller that penetrated the cockpit and killed instantly both pilots. Out of control, the airplane also dove into the ground. Both aircraft crashed onto several houses located 4,5 km from the airport. All 9 crew members were killed as well as six people on the ground. 23 others were injured, 12 of them seriously.
