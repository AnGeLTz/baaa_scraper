The pilot-in-command abandoned the approach, started a go-around procedure and diverted to Nha Trang. Few minutes later, while cruising in a limited visibility due to low clouds, the airplane struck tree tops and crashed on the top of a wooded mountain. As the airplane crashed in an enemy zone, SAR could not reach the site. The wreckage was eventually found few weeks later. All 26 occupants have been killed. At the time of the accident, the visibility was poor and the mountain was shrouded in clouds. \r\nCrew:\r\nMaj Thomas Dewey Moore,\r\nMaj William Jerome Clark,\r\nS/Sgt Arturo Delgado-Marin,\r\nS/Sgt Stanley Joseph Yurewicz.", "probable_cause": null}
