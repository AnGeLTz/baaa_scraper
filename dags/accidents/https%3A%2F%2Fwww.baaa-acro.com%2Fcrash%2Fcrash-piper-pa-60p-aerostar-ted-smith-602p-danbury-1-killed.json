He then decided to abort the landing, added power, and when airborne, retracted the landing gear. He said he asked the right front seat (non-rated) passenger to reset the flaps (to 20\u00b0). The pilot saw trees ahead, and realized the airplane was not going to clear the obstacles, though full power was applied. Just before impact, he pulled back on the elevator control to soften the impact, rather than hitting the trees nose first. After the accident, the wing flaps were found in the retracted position. A passenger was killed and three other occupants were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's delay in initiating a go-around (aborted landing) and failure to assure that the flaps were properly reset for the go-around. Factors relating to the  accident were: the pilot's failure to achieve the proper touchdown point for landing, the wet runway condition, and the proximity of tree(s) to the runway."}
