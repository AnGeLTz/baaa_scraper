A crew member was seriously injured while all eight other occupants were killed as well as two people in the house. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the right engine oversped due a structural shortcoming of the screw regulator. Regarding the loss of power on the left engine, it was not possible to determine its cause due to the fact that the engine was totally destroyed by fire. An unappropriated reaction of the crew to the double engine dysfunction was considered as a contributory factor. "}
