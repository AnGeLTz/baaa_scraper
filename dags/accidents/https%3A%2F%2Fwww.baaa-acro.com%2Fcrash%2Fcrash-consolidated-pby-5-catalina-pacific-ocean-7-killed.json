Structural failure as the result of high winds and strong vertical currents encountered in the storm may have cause the plane to crash into the water. The plane may have exploded mid-air due to accidental ignition of high octane gasoline vapor present in the plane as a result of transfer of fuel from hull tanks to wing tanks. These vapors may have ignited by static spark, an accidental spark from other sources or lightning. Crew members of one of the other planes saw a large red flash in the clouds which appeared to localized to be lightning."}
