While descending to Pozna\u0144 at an altitude of 7,000 feet, the crew was informed about weather conditions at destination with a visibility of 700 metres, an RVR of 650 metres and a ceiling at 200 feet. After being cleared to descent to runway 29, the crew was informed about local patches of fog at the airport and the RVR dropped to 350 metres. On short final, at a height of about 500 feet, as the crew was unable to establish any visual contact with the approach lights and the runway lights, the captain decided to initiate a go-around procedure. Shortly later, the aircraft struck the ground to the left of the runway. Upon impact, the undercarriage were torn off. The aircraft slid for about 150 metres and came to rest with both engines and the left wing torn of as well. All six occupants escaped uninjured. ", "probable_cause": null}
