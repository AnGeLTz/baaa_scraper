Doing so, the visibility was reduced by dust which had been raised during the engine reverse operation. The crew failed to realize the aircraft departed the runway to the right when the right wing struck two parked tractors. Fuel tanks were punctured and a fire broke out. The crew immediately stopped the airplane and all 33 occupants evacuated the cabin. There were no injuries but the aircraft was destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": null}
