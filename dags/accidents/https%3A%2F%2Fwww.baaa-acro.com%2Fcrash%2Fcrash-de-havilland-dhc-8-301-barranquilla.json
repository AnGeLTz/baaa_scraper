The aircraft landed 770 metres past the runway threshold. After touchdown, the crew noticed vibrations coming from the right side of the aircraft when the right main gear collapsed. The aircraft slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest on the main runway. All 31 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Fracture of the ring of the mechanical stop of the shock absorber on the right main gear, turning the whole gear into a solid structure incapable of absorbing the landing loads, due to the non-incorporation of the Airworthiness Directive AD-2006-14 in the general repair of the main gear."}
