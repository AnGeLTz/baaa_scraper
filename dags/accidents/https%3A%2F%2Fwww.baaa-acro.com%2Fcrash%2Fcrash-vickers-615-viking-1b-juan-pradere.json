Due to sufficient fuel reserve, the captain decided to cancel the fuel stop in Bah\u00eda Blanca and continued directly towards Comodoro Rivadavia. While approaching Trelew, he encountered foggy conditions and decided to return to Bah\u00eda Blanca as Comodoro Rivadavia was also in fog. Due to low visibility, he lost his orientation and flew over the sea before flying back overt the continent. Few minutes later, both engines failed due to fuel exhaustion. He reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing in a prairie located near Juan A. Pradere. After touchdown, the airplane hit trees and bushes about 2 meters high, swung and came to rest with its right wing torn off to the engine. All 23 occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was considered as damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Double engine failure caused by a fuel exhaustion. "}
