He stated that during climbout N3643R began an uncommanded roll to the left at approximately 600 feet. The pilot regained roll control just prior to ground impact. The Piper Aerostar is certificated without a stall warning device. The wind at Stapleton Airport at the time N3643R took off was 170\u00b0 at 20 knots with gusts to 28 knots. According to the pilot operating handbook, the demonstrated crosswind component is 15 knots. All four occupants were injured, one seriously.
