It then impacted trees about 1/3 mile from the departure end of the runway. Damage to the trees indicated that the airplane was in a right bank at impact. Both propellers showed evidence of rotation at impact. Estimated weight calculations showed that the airplane was at least 165 lbs in excess of max gross weight; this does not include an unknown amount of fuel on board prior to the last refueling. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during takeoff. Factors which contributed to the accident were: the pilot's failure to ensure that the airplane maximum gross takeoff weight was not exceeded, the dark night, and rain."}
