That day, the crew was engaged in a fire fighting mission in the region of Banyeres de Mariola, in the Sierra de Mariola, about 90 km south of Valencia. The crew approached the fire zone at a too low altitude, dropped the water load too late, causing the aircraft to stall while trying to 'hop' over a mountain. The aircraft struck the ground and crashed some 10 metres below the summit. A crew member was seriously injured while five other occupants were killed. \r\ninjured", "probable_cause": null}
