The aircraft departed Brussels-Haren Airport at 1220LT with eight passengers and two crew members on board. While overflying the West Flanders, the crew encountered poor visibility due to foggy conditions. Apparently lost, the crew deviated from the prescribed flight path by 15 km when the captain decided to reduce his altitude to establish a visual contact with the ground. At a height of about 250 feet, the airplane collided with a 270 metres high radio antenna. Upon impact, the right wing was torn off and the airplane crashed in an open field, bursting into flames. All 10 occupants were killed, among them seven British, two Dutch and one Polish. ", "probable_cause": null}
