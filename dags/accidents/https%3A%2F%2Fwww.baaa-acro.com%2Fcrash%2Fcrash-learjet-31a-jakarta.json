The approach was completed by night and marginal weather conditions. After touchdown on runway 24, the aircraft skidded on a wet runway. After a course of 1,300 metres, it veered to the right and departed the runway surface. While contacting soft ground, the right main gear was torn off while the left main gear partially collapsed. Then the aircraft bounced and impacted the ground several times, causing the left wing to be bent. Eventually, the right engine partially detached from the pylon. All eight occupants were rescued and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. There was no fire. ", "probable_cause": null}
