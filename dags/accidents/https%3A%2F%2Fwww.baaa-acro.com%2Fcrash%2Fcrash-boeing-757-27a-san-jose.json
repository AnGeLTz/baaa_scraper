After being cleared to return, the crew followed a holding pattern and the aircraft landed on runway 07 at 1024LT. After touchdown, the crew initiated the braking procedure then the aircraft started to veer to the right, apparently to vacate via taxiway Delta and Kilo. It skidded to the right, made an almost 90\u00b0 turn, descended a bank, lost its undercarriage and came to rest in a grassy area located about five metres below the runway elevation, broken in two. Both pilots evacuated with minor injuries. ", "probable_cause": null}
