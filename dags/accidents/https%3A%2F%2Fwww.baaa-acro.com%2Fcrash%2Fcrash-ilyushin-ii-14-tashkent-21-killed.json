During the second approach, as he was unable to locate the runway, the crew again decided to make a go around when, at a height of 100-150 meters, the airplane stalled, banked right and crashed in a snowy field. All 21 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of wrong decision on part of the crew who decided to continue the approach below weather minima conditions.
