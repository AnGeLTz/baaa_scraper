Decision was taken to abandon the takeoff procedure and the crew was able to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway. All 19 occupants evacuated while the aircraft was quickly destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": "The NASA Aircraft Accident Investigation Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was the nearly simultaneous failure of the two front tires on the right main landing gear at a critical time during the takeoff roll. These failures resulted in the pilot's decision to reject the takeoff. Contributing to the severity of the accident was an intense fire fed by leakage from the puncture of a right-wing fuel tank forward of the right main gear; the puncture occurred during the intentional extended rollout of the aircraft."}
