He made a go-around and initiated another approach with the engine shut down. He was unable to maintain altitude and the aircraft began a decent that was not arrested. Subsequently, it crashed into 2 homes, approximately 6 miles from the airport. An exam of the left engine revealed the drive shaft from the fuel pump to the fuel control was sheared at the plastic coupling. Further exam revealed the twin bearings that supported the driveshaft had failed. Also, there was evidence the drive shaft had shifted and subsequently an overtorque condition resulted. All three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper in-flight planning/decision, which resulted in his failure to maintain control of the aircraft.
