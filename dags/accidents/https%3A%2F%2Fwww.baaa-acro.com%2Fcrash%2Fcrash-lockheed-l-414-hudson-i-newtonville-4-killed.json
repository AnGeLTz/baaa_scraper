As the flight progressed, the crew pressed on into deteriorating weather, including low ceiling and poor visibility. It is thought that the pilot was trying to locate a safe landing site near Newtonville when the starboard wing struck some trees while it was making a 45\u00b0 bank turn. The Hudson impacted the ground and disintegrated, killing all four occupants. ", "probable_cause": "Investigation concluded that the pilot lost visual reference to the ground during a steep turn towards rising terrain without first gaining a safe altitude. A contributing factor was the fact that the Hudson had a tendency to experience some loss of control during a steep turn."}
