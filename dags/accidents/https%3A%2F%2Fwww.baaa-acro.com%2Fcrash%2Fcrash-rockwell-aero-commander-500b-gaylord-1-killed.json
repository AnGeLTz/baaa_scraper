Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The airplane was equipped with an \"icing protection system\" and a report by another airplane that flew the approach and landed without incident indicated that light rime icing was encountered during the approach. Radar data shows that the accident airplane flew the localizer course inbound and began a descent past the final approach fix. No mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation were noted with the airplane.", "probable_cause": "The clearance not maintained with terrain during a non precision approach. Contributing factors were the ceiling, visibility, night conditions, and trees."}
