About six minutes after departure, the airplane collided with a hilly terrain located near Novoselovo (the Novoselovo Airport is located 18 km west of Koma). The wreckage was found later in the afternoon. Three passengers were injured while 10 other occupants, among them both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew was flying under VFR mode in adverse weather conditions (snow falls) when the airplane struck the ground. It was reported that the cold front should pass later that day so the crew was not informed about such conditions en route. A poor flight preparation was considered as a contributing factor. "}
