After the tank was released, the pilot of the C-40A made a quick turn to the left, striking the C-54 right wingtip. The C-40A entered a spin and crashed near the runway, killing all five crew members. The C-54 continued on for 700 feet, allowing two passengers to bail out. The plane then crashed in a vertical dive, killing three other crewmen.\r\nSource: http://www.joebaugher.com/", "probable_cause": "Wrong judgement on part of the C-40 crew. "}
