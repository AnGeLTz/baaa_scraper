Airport manager heard unicom transmission from N36CA, 'we lost an engine, we're coming back.' A warning horn (possibly gear warning or stall horn) was heard in the background of the transmission. When N36CA failed to return the airport manager called the sheriff and began search in his own aircraft. N36CA was located approximately one hour after it's departure. The forced landing was in a flat, wings level attitude with 22\u00b0 of flaps extended. Initial impact occurred in area of 8 feet high brush. Distance from initial impact to final rest was 595 feet on heading of 140\u00b0. Although restrained by lap belt and harness, pilot hit head on copilot's control yoke during the accident. The left eng turbine blade had failed in fatigue. The pilot's son said his father shut down the right engine in-flight and as a result the aircraft had no power on either engine. All three occupants were injured.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (total) - mech failure/malf\r\nPhase of operation: climb - to cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
