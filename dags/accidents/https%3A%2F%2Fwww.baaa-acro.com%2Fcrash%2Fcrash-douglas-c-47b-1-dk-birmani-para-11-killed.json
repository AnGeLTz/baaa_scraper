The pilot radioed Barrackpore at 06:10 UTC to report he had passed over Akyab at 05:30 UTC, was flying on instruments, and expected to arrive at Barrackpore at 08:00 UTC. At 06:15 UTC he called for weather, which Barrackpore had to send twice due to heavy atmospheric interference. At 07:05 UTC the pilot mistakenly responded to a call from Barrackpore to another aircraft and said he had nothing for Barrackpore. This was the last contact with the flight. The wreckage was discovered in January 2012 by the Indian paramilitary Assam Rifles. The site was found after a four-month search operation.\nSource: http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19460517-1", "probable_cause": null}
