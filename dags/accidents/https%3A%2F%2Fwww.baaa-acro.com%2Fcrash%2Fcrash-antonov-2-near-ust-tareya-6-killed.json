Upon arrival, the pilot (M. N. Tomilin) decided not to land on the airfield but close to the buildings of the GGU geological expedition. Due to strong cross winds and the difficulties of the terrain, he was unable to land and was forced to make a go around. After three unsuccessful attempts to land, he elected to go around again when the aircraft, with full flaps extended, encountered gusty winds and lost speed. The left wing stalled and the aircraft crashed in flames, killing all six occupants. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration and poor flight organization. The following factors were pointed out:\n- Lack of discipline on part of the pilot-in-command who attempted to land in difficult conditions on an unprepared terrain while an existing airfield was close to his position,\n- Wrong piloting techniques when the pilot-in-command elected to make a go around with full flaps extended, \n- Insufficient speed which contributed, with strong winds, to the stall of the aircraft.
