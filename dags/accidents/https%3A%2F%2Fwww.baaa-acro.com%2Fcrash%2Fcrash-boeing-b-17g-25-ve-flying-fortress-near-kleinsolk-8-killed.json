While flying over the Alps in poor weather conditions, the crew encountered technical problems with two engines and was able to send a mayday message at 1042LT. Two crew members bailed out before the aircraft crashed in a mountainous region located near Kleins\u00f6lk, some 80 km southeast of Salzburg. While both 'jumpers' were found alive, no trace of the aircraft was found and all search operations were suspended after few days. Sixty years later, in 2004, the wreckage was eventually found.  At the time of the accident, the weather conditions were bad with strong winds as well. \r\nCrew (301st BG): \r\n2nd Lt Albert H. Mitchko, pilot, \u2020\r\n1st Lt Philip M.
