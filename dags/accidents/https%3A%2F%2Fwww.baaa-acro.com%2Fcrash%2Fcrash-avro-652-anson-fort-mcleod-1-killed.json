Burcher.\nSource: \nhttp://www.rafcommands.com/forum/showthread.php?8451-Anson-incident-Macleod-22-4-1943", "probable_cause": "The conclusion of the AIB was that the controller on duty was negligent in allowing aircraft to take off and land when he did not know the location of the aircraft he had previously given permission to land despite the fact that he had known the position of such aircraft, the taking off of the others might have been permitted safely. In conclusion, LAC Crotty failed to see LAC Burcher whose electrical systems had apparently failed and who made no effort to warn the Control Officer by means of a flashlight."}
