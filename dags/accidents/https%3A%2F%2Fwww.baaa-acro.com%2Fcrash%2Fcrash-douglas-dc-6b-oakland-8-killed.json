At this time, weather conditions were considered as good. On approach to Oakland runway 27R, the pilot-in-command descended below the minimum safe altitude of 500 feet when the aircraft hit the water, exploded and sank into the Bay of Oakland. A stewardess and a passenger were rescued while eight other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the pilot\u2019s action in continuing descent below the 500-feet prescribed minimum altitude until the aircraft struck the water. A probable contributing factor to the aircraft striking the water was the sensory illusion experienced by the pilots. The following findings were pointed out:\r\n- The reported weather conditions at San Francisco and Oakland at the time of departure were above the prescribed minima,\r\n- Actual weather conditions over the Bay at the time and place of the accident were later determined to be below the prescribed minima for trans-bay clearance,\r\n- The pilot of the aircraft failed to comply with the instructions provided in the Visual Trans-Bay procedures which are to be followed in case ceiling and/or visibility below prescribed minima are encountered en route,\r\n- No evidence was found of mechanical malfunction of the aircraft or any of its components recovered,\r\n- The flight descended below minimum specified altitude in an attempt to maintain visual reference."}
