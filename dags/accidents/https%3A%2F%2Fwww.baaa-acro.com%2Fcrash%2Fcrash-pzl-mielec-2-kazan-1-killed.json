The captain decided to maintain a low altitude and initiated a turn to the left when the engine failed completely 18 seconds later. While turning to the left at an angle of 20-27\u00b0 and at a speed of 135 km/h, the airplane stalled, struck telephone wires and crashed in flames. The captain was killed while 10 other occupants were injured. The aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": "Engine failure at low height after takeoff over a populated area. The main cause of engine failure was a rupture of the cylinder n\u00b08, which caused a leak and overheating. The presence of cracks in the right magneto slider BSM-9 also contributed to the engine failure. This caused the fuel-air mixture in the intake manifold to ignite."}
