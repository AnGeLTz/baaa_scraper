About 15 minutes prior to arrival, the pilot cancelled his IFR flight plan and started the descent under VFR mode. On approach, at an altitude of 1,700 feet and at a speed of 110 knots, the aircraft struck tree tops and crashed in a wooded and hilly terrain located east of Dossenheim, about 15 km southeast of Mannheim Airport, bursting into flames. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and the pilot, sole on board, was seriously injured. He died from his injuries two weeks later. ", "probable_cause": "The decision of the pilot to continue the approach under VFR mode in IMC conditions. The limited visibility caused by low clouds was considered as a contributing factor. At the time of the accident, the hilly terrain was shrouded in clouds. For unknown reasons, the approach speed was relatively low (110 knots)."}
