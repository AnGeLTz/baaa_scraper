The aircraft turned onto the runway heading and was slightly left of the runway centreline. It commenced a descent and a left turn, with the descent continuing to 100 ft. The pilot made a short radio transmission during the turn and then the aircraft\u2019s altitude increased rapidly to 600 ft before it descended and disappeared from the radar. The aircraft probably stalled in the final pull-up manoeuvre, leading to loss of control and impact with the sea, fatally injuring those on board, Carl Whiteley and his wife. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was probably as a result of the pilot\u2019s attempt to recover to normal flight following a stall or significant loss of airspeed at a low height, after a rapid climb manoeuvre having become disoriented during the approach in fog."}
