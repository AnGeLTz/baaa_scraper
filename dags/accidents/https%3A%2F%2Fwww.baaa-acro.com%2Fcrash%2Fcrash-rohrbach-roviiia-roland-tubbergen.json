While cruising northeast of Almelo, thick white smoke spread in the cabin and the captain decided to reduce his altitude and to attempt an emergency landing. The aircraft landed in an open field located in Tubbergen and came to rest, bursting into flames. All eight occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was partially destroyed by fire. \r\nCrew:\r\nA. K\u00fcnstle, pilot,\r\nF. Zimmerman, engineer,\r\nMr. Seiffert, radio navigator.\r\nPassengers:\r\nMr. Holtz,\r\nMr. Hapborn,\r\nMr. Herath,\r\nMr. Wuster,\r\nMr. Carr.", "probable_cause": "It was not clearly determined what was the origin of the fire. It is possible that fire started by a heating pipe or was caused by a short-circuit that occurred in the radio electrical system. These assumptions have not been proven while investigators are almost certain that the fire broke out under the pilot's seat."}
