En route, the crew encountered technical problems with the electrical system when the right generator failed. The crew attempted to start the APU several times but without success when the left generator also failed. The undercarriage were lowered manually and the landing was completed on a wet runway in rainy conditions. After touchdown, the crew started the braking procedure but was unable to deploy the thrust reversers. At a speed of 140-160 km/h, the aircraft overran, lost its undercarriage and came to rest in a waterlogged land. All 11 occupants were rescued, among them six were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": null}
