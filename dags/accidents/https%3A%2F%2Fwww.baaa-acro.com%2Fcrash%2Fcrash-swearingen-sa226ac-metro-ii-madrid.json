On final, the crew forgot to lower the gear and the aircraft landed on its belly and slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest. Both pilots escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The crew failed to follow the approach check-list and to lower the gear, causing the aircraft to land on its belly. The alarm coupled to the undercarriage sounded in the cockpit but neither the pilot nor the copilot heard it and no corrective action was made. The crew was apparently distracted by heavy traffic."}
