Weather conditions along the route were poor with low visibility, cloud at 2,000 - 3,000 feet and snow falls. At 1506LT, the crew received the permission to descend from 12,000 to 6,000 feet towards Florence. As the aircraft failed to arrive, SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found.
