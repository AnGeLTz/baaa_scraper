The flight was without incident until when holding over Radio Beacon Bella, three of the aircraft's four engines stopped. It lost height and a forced landing was made at 0403 hours GMT, 14 miles northwest of Kastrup. The aircraft was considerably damaged, but there was no fire. The crew were not injured.", "probable_cause": "The cause of the engine failures, which brought about the accident, lay in the accumulation of ice on the engine cowlings which, because of malfunctioning of the de-icing system, was allowed to build up before being dislodged. Passage of the lumps of ice through the engines caused partial flame out, which produced sufficient loss of power to initiate the auto-feathering and thus to stop the engines."}
