At 1555LT, during the takeoff roll, after a course of 450 metres, the pilot realized he could not liftoff so he returned to the hangar, thinking that the engine was not producing sufficient power due to sparking plugs issue. Following verification, he decided to attempt a second takeoff at 1613LT. After a course of 350 metres, the aircraft lifted off then climbed to a height of about 10 metres when it stalled, rolled to the right and crashed. All four occupants were slightly injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Despite his experience on this type of aircraft (116 flights), the pilot Walter Kuhlmay failed to realize that the airplane was too heavy at takeoff. "}
