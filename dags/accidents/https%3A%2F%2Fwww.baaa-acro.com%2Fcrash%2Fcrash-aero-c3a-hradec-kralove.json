Shortly after takeoff, while climbing to a height of about 30 feet, the aircraft turned slightly to the right and it is believed that the right engine lost power. The pilot-in-command made a turn to the left, raised the flaps and nosed down to gain speed that increased up to 200 km/h when the aircraft hit the ground and eventually crashed in a field. While all three crew members were uninjured, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. \nCrew:\nLt Ernest Trabatick\u00fd  2.", "probable_cause": "No technical anomalies were found on the aircraft and the cause of the accident was attributed to a pilot error.
