At Kharkiv Airport, some equipment were unloaded then the crew continued to Kiev where the airplane landed at 1915LT. Because it was too dangerous to leave an airplane at Kiev for the overnight, the crew was instructed to continue to Mirgorod. Upon arrival, the pilot was unable to locate the runway due to the lack of visibility (night), the absence of ground light and the fact that the left headlight of the airplane failed about 20 minutes prior to landing. At a height of about 10-15 metres, the pilot saw the masts of antennas and made a sharp turn to the left to avoid the collision when the airplane stalled and crash landed. All 24 occupants evacuated safely while the airplane was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
