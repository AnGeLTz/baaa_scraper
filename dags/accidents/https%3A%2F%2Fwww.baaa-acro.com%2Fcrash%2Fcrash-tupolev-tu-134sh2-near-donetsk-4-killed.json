The aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and 38 seconds later, at an altitude of 2,750 meters, it disintegrated in the air and eventually crashed in a field located near Donetsk. All 3 crew members and the sole passenger (the commander of VVVAUSh) were killed.", "probable_cause": "The cause of the accident was that the back-up DR-134M yaw damper power wires had been cross wired to the wrong contacts during overhaul at Chelyabinsk facilities and the damper induced yaw instead of damping it when it kicked in during severe atmospheric turbulences, overstressing the airframe after 38 seconds."}
