En route, the pilot informed ground about technical problems and decided to divert to Clinton-Sherman Airport. For unknown reason, the crew mistook the airport and landed on runway 17 (4,300 feet long) at Clinton-Regional Airport. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran, lost its landing gear and came to rest in a field, broken in three. All five crew members were rescued while the forward section was destroyed by a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "An overheated brake ignited hydraulic fluid in the left aft landing gear well. The fire ignited tires and other components before burning through the keel beam and continuing into the right aft well. This was probably caused by a problem that occurred during taxiing at Altus AFB. "}
