From Mandalay (MDL) on the way back to Yangon International Airport, the plane took off at 17:20.On the way the weather was not significant. For weather reason, seat belt sign was turned on the way to Yangon International Airport only one time. From Mandalay Airport up to landing phase to Yangon International Airport, first officer took control of the aircraft. At 1730 visibility was 6Km as per ATC verbal information. About 4 Km to Mingaladon Tower, clearance was obtained \"Air Bagan 424 ,wind calm ,runway 21,clear to land, caution landing Runway wet, after landed vacate via Charlie\" At decision height (250ft), runway was insight, runway lightings were able to be seen so the aircraft continued though there was light rain. At about 50 ft, more rain was falling suddenly consequently visibility became poor. So the pilot took over control of the aircraft. A few seconds later the aircraft made hard landing and skidded and veered off the left side of the runway to the muddy strip, came to rest about 2800ft from the threshold and 75ft from the runway edge.
