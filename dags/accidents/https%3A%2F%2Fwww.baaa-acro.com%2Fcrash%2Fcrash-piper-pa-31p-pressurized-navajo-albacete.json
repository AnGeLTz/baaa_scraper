At 1840LT, while descending to Alicante, the pilot contacted ATC and reported a low fuel situation. After being vectored to Albacete-Los Llanos AFB, he modified his route and started the descent for an approach to runway 09. Four minutes later, at an altitude of 3,000 feet and a distance of 8 NM, he declared an emergency following an engine failure. Two minutes later, the aircraft crashed near Chinchilla, about 10 km southeast of the airport. All six occupants were rescued and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Failure of both engines in flight due to fuel exhaustion. This situation was probably the consequence of an incorrect fuel consumption calculation prior to departure, combined with a possible over-consumption in flight. "}
