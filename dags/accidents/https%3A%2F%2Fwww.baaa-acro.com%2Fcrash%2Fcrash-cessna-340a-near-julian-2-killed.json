During the final 12 minutes of the flight (from 1046 to 1058 Pacific daylight time), recorded military search radar height values (primary radar returns) show the aircraft in a steady descent from 11,000 feet to 5,600 feet, where radar contact was lost. During the same time interval, recorded Mode C altitudes received at Los Angeles Air Traffic Control Center (Center) and SoCal Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) indicated the aircraft was level at 11,000 feet. At 1055:49, when the pilot was handed off from SoCal TRACON to Los Angeles Center, the pilot checked in with the Center \". . . level at one one thousand.\" At 1057:28, the pilot asked the Center controller \"what altitude you showing us at\" to which the controller responded \"not receiving your mode C right now sir.\" At 1057:37, the pilot transmitted \"o k we'd like to climb to vfr on top, our uh altimeter just went down to uh fifty three hundred.\" The controller approved the pilot's request to climb to VFR conditions on-top and, at 1057:54, the pilot responded \"roger we're out.\" No further transmissions were received from the aircraft. The airplane was equipped with a single instrument static pressure system with two heated static ports. The static system and static system instruments were damaged or destroyed by impact and post-crash fire sufficiently to preclude post-accident testing.", "probable_cause": "Total blockage of the instrument static system due to ice."}
