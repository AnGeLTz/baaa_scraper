He set up an approach to land to the south in Dodger Channel, into the wind. On short final, the pilot noticed a shoal so he decided to overshoot, make a circuit, and land beyond the shoal. He applied power, established a climb and began a left turn. As the aircraft turned, it came into the lee of Diana Island. The aircraft encountered subsiding air and began to descend. The pilot was unable to arrest the descent. The aircraft struck the water and sank. All six occupants escaped without any injury but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": null}
