About a minute after takeoff, while in initial climb, the engine lost power. The crew informed ATC about the situation and was cleared for an immediate return. Shortly later, the engine failed and the crew attempted an emergency landing in an open field located near the aerodrome. Upon landing, the aircraft collided with a small drainage ditch, lost its left main gear and both left wings before coming to rest. All four occupants escaped with minor injuries and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The reason for the loss of engine power in flight, most likely, was a reduction in the filing of the gasoline due to clogging of fuel filters. The appearance, structure and nature of the impurities found in the fuel on the aircraft were not characteristic of impurities accumulated in the fuel supply system in normal operating conditions. The source of the impurities in aircraft fuel system could not be found."}
