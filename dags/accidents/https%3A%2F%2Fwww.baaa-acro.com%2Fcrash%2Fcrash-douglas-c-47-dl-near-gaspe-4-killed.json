At 1434LT, the pilot informed ATC he was flying under IFR at an altitude of 7,000 feet near Chatham and estimated his position over Seven Islands at 1544LT. This was the last radio transmission as the aircraft disappeared shortly later from the radar screens. SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the occupants was found. The wreckage was eventually spotted by the pilot of a Trans-Gaspesian Airline aircraft on 27 August 1953. ", "probable_cause": null}
