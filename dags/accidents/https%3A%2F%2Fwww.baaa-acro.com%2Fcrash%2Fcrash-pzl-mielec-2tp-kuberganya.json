It stalled, struck the ground and crash landed in a snow covered field, coming to rest 171 meters past the runway end. All 15 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew failed to prepare the flight according to published procedures and failed to follow the pre-takeoff checklist. Investigations reported that the flaps were deployed at an inappropriate angle of 8\u00b0 instead of the prescribed 30\u00b0. At liftoff, the copilot realized the mistake and reduced the engine power to abandon the takeoff procedure but the captain took over controls and decided to continue the takeoff. Thus, the poor crew coordination was considered as a contributing factor. "}
