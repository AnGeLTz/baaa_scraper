Shortly later, the single engine aircraft impacted the slope of a mountain. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "It is the opinion of the accident Board that the lack of evidence makes any definite conclusions as to the probably cause of this accident a matter of conjecture. The most logical assumption appears to be that the battery-generator system failed, thus causing an error in the ship's compass and probably affecting other essential navigation instruments. The lack of visibility caused by night and clouds should be considered as a contributory factor. "}
