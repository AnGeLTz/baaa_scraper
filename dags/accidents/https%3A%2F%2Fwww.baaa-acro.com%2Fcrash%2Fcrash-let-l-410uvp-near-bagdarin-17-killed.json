The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 17 occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, the visibility was poor due to low clouds and snow falls.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew made a wrong flight time calculation and misevaluated the climbing time, causing a discrepancy of 11 minutes. Due to radio communications problems and also unstable radiogoniometric systems, ATC was unable to establish the exact position of the aircraft. The crew started the approach prematurely, causing the aircraft to descent below the minimum safe altitude. Due to lack of visibility, the crew was unable to see and avoid the mountain. "}
