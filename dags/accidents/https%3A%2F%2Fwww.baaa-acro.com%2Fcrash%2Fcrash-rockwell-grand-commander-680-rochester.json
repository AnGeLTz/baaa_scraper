The pilot increased power on the right engine and feathered the left propeller. After passing over the M2 highway at a speed of 100 knots, he expected to return to the airfield when the right engine lost power as well. He attempted an emergency landing by the motorway and the airplane crash landed at a speed of 85 knots before coming to rest. All four occupants were injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by kerosene being placed in a petrol supply at Rochester City Airport. The aircraft, which had been refuelled with the mixed product from the supply, suffered a loss of engine power after takeoff. Thus led to a forced landing in difficult circumstances on unsuitable terrain. The loss of engine power resulted from damage to the engines due to their being run on contaminated fuel. "}
