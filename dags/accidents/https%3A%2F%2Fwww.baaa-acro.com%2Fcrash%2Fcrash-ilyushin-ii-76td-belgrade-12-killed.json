Following a night takeoff from Belgrade-Sur\u010din Airport, the crew informed ATC about technical problems and reported the loss of all electrical power. Following a holding pattern for about 2,5 hours, the crew attempted to land but the visibility was low due to poor weather conditions. On short final, without any headlights, the aircraft struck the ground and crashed 800 metres short of runway, bursting into flames. All 12 occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that prior to takeoff from Belgrade-Sur\u010din Airport, while preparing the flight, the crew forgot to switch on the VU-6A AC/DC converter after start-up of the engines, causing the 27 volts electrical system to be constantly fed from the batteries. When batteries ran flat, all the avionic and boosters were left without power. "}
