While outbound, the starboard engine caught fire and the heavily laden aircraft began to lose height. The pilot was reluctant to jettison the bomb load for fear of injuring people on the ground, but as a precaution he ordered six of the crew to bail out. The two pilots then tried to make an emergency landing, but in the pitch black conditions they failed to see a line of trees and the Manchester crashed at 0620LT at Wiltshire Cross near Tidworth. Both pilots were killed and all six other crew members parachuted to safety. \r\nCrew:\r\nP/O Douglas Spencer Matthews, pilot, \u2020\r\nP/O  Thomas Ivor Ravenhill Wilson, copilot, \u2020\r\nF/O C.
