At 0310, the aircraft departed Milwaukee in VFR. En route, the pilot obtained weather and an IFR clearance. Some of his radio transmissions were not standard. At 0433, he complied with ATC request for frequency change, but his radio transmissions were not clear. Approximately 5 minutes later, ATC asked the pilot to change frequency again, but 5 calls were made before he replied. His last transmission was at 0445:48; he didn't respond to further ATC calls. The aircraft continued cruising at 11,000 feet until 0621, then it descended without clearance. Radar contact was lost at 0627 cst (0727 est). Shortly thereafter, it impacted trees on a mountain, then crashed to the ground and burned. A witness believed the engines were throttled back before impact. Also, the witness reported low clouds and fog, but said the mountain was visible and was not obscured. The pilot had a 1,58\u2030 alcohol level in blood, no sleep for 21.5 hours, history of alcohol abuse, 7 prior dwi convictions (and ndr rec). Also, he falsified FAA medical applications. FAA was advised in 1984, but took no action. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
