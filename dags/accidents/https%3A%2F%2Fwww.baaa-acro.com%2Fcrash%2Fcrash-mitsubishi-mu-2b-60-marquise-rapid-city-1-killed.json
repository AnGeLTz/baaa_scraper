One witness (an ATP pilot) reported the aircraft attained an altitude of approximately 75 to 100 feet and appeared to slow down and enter a VMC roll, then it crashed. Impact occurred in an inverted, nose down attitude, left of the runway. An investigation revealed that a coupling shaft (PN 865888-3) had failed in the left engine and the left prop had feathered. A metallurgical examination of the coupling showed evidence of fatigue. One pilot was killed and three other occupants were injured, one seriously. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed (VMC), which resulted in a loss of aircraft control. A factor related to the accident was: fatigue failure of a coupling shaft in the #1 engine, which resulted in loss of power in that engine."}
