His attending physician suggested approximately 1 year period of recuperation due to equilibrium problems associated with this type of surgery. On 7/12/86, he had a 1st class medical exam and received a medical  certificate which was valid for flight test only. On 8/28/86, while taking off at night, the aircraft collided with rising terrain approximately 1.5 mile from the end of the runway at an elevation of about 5,600 feet.
