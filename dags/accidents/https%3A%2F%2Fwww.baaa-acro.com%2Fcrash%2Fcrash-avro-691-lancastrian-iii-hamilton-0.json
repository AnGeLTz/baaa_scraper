The crew elected to return to Hamilton-Kindley Field for an emergency landing. On final approach, the aircraft stalled and crashed few hundred yards short of runway threshold. All 16 occupants were uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the failure on engine number four remains unknown. However, it was determined that on final approach, the aircraft stalled when the crew selected full flaps down. At that time, the crew was subject to a certain tension due to the emergency situation and their perception, reaction and judgement were reduced, maybe due to the high concentration of fuel vapor in the cockpit, which remains a contributory factor."}
