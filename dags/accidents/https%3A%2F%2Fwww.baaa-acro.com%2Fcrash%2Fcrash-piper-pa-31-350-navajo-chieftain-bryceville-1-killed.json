After departure pilot failed to maintain assigned headings several times and had to be corrected by ATC. After 15 minutes of flight the pilot reported he was having problems with the right engine and would like to return to the airport. ATC advised the pilot that Craig Airport was available and was currently reporting VFR conditions. Pilot stated he wanted to go to Jax int'l because the 4,000 feet runway at Craig was not long enough. Jax int'l was reporting IFR conditions. The pilot continued to have trouble holding headings while being vectored for an ILS approach. While in the downwind  position for the approach the pilot asked ATC, 'how far is 982 from landing?'. As the aircraft was turned onto the localizer the pilot called and stated he had lost control and was in a spin. Post crash inspection of the right engine revealed the #5 cylinder had detonated until a hole was burned in the piston. Additionally the #5 and #6 rods had burn damage and the #6 rod bolts had failed in overload. The pilot was killed and both passengers were injured.
