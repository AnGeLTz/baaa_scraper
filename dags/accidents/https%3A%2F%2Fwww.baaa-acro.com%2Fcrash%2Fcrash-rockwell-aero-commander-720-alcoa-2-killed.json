While on final approach after descending 1,300 feet below minimum procedure turn altitude followed by being told the aircraft was well above the glideslope, ATC instructed the pilot to maintain 3,000 feet. Shortly thereafter, ATC reported the mode C indicated 1,900. The pilot responded with 'engine quit'. The aircraft crashed in a pasture about 1 mile from the airport. The investigation revealed that the aircraft was not equipped to operate in icing conditions. The evidence indicated that the flaps and landing gear were extended. Approximately 40 lbs of cocaine were found onboard the aircraft. The tox report for the pilot disclosed .05 mg/l benzoylecognite (cocaine metabolite) in his blood. The pilot had received a weather briefing which included a freezing level at 7,000 feet and filed a flight plan requesting a cruising altitude of 14,000 feet. Both occupants were killed. \n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (total) - nonmechanical\r\nPhase of operation: approach - iaf to faf/outer marker (ifr)\r\nFindings\r\n1.
