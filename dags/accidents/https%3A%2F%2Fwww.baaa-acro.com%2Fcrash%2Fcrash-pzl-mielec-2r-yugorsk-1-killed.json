Shortly after take off from runway 31, while climbing to a height of about 80 meters, the engine suffered a power loss. The pilot initiated a left turn to reach the airport when the aircraft rolled to an angle of 60\u00b0 then stalled and crashed in a snow covered field near a forest, bursting into flames. The aircraft was destroyed by a post impact fire. Nine occupants escaped injured and a passenger was killed. ", "probable_cause": " Most probably the accident with  and An-2 RA-33589 aircraft was caused by aircraft beyond stall angle of attack entry during dynamic turn for emergency landing with reverse runway heading due to engine failure after take-off at low-altitude followed by shaking and its power loss resulted in aircraft ground impact with bank angle more than 60\u00b0. Engine failure was caused by high-temperature damage and destruction of cylinder-piston group details due to it inadequate technical operation and using motor gasoline in aircraft fuel flow system which quality didn't comply with requirements for preferred AI-95 gasoline in accordance with aeronautical equipment flight service evaluation program, Order of Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation \u2116 \u041d\u0410-131-\u0440 from April 11, 2001 and engineering solution \u2116 \u0410\u0411-1236-2003 from May 22, 2003. Most probably the contributing factor was partial skill loss of An-2 aircraft control by aircraft pilot in command (PIC). Flight operation was performed by PIC, meteorological minimas and which authorizations written in Private-Pilot License and the fact of medical flight-expert commission procedure were not documented. PIC's decision to perform straight-ahead landing most probably didn't allow to reduce the severity of accident consequences."}
