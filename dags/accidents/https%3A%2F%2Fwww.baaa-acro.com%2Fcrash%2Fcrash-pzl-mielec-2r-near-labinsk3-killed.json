While cruising at low height, the pilot-in-command made a sharp turn when control was lost. The aircraft banked to a 50-60\u00b0 angle then crashed in an open field. Both pilots and the sole passenger (an aircraft mechanic) were killed.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the loss of control was caused by the fact that the pilot-in-command attempted to make a sharp turn at low height at an angle of minimum 45\u00b0 which is prohibited as the procedure allows a max angle of 30\u00b0. It is believed the crew was distracted at the time of the loss of control. "}
