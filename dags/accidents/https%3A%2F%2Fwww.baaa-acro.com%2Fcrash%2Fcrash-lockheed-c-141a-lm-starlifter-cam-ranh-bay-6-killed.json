The copilot inadvertently missed the item referring to the automatic Spoiler Select Switch. The switch should have been in the \"Rejected Takeoff\" (RTO) position, but was in the \"Autoland\" position when the airplane departed. Unnoticed by the crew, between 34-60 Knots, the spoilers automatically deployed to the ground position. The crew noticed a reduced acceleration rate, but elected to continue the takeoff. The aircraft became airborne, accelerated poorly and began a shallow descent. It crashed into the sea just off the end of the runway. Six crew members were killed while two others were rescued. \r\nThose killed were:\r\nMaj Harry Milton Brenn,\r\nCpt Morris Bowdoin Witt,\r\nSMS Roy Earl Shults,\r\nM/Sgt Herman Eugene Miller,\r\nT/Sgt Marshall Edward Brown,\r\nT/Sgt Harold Eugene Mahy.
