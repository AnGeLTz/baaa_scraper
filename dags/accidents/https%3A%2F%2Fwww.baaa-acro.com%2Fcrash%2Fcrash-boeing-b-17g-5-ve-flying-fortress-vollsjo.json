En route, it was attacked by enemy fire. Engines number one and three were out of service, and the fourth engine failed shortly later. While approaching the Bornholm Island, the pilot decided to divert to Sweden and instructed all crew to bail out. Unfortunately, his parachute opened in the cabin so he was forced to attempt an emergency landing in an open field located in Vollsj\u00f6, south Sweden. The aircraft belly landed and came to rest. All ten occupants were uninjured while the aircraft christened 'Lackin Shackin' was damaged beyond repair. \nCrew (91st BG):\n1st Lt F. C. Amman, pilot, \n2nd Lt F. L. Butler, copilot,\n1st Lt H. A.
