Following a night takeoff, the aircraft climbed to a height of 200 metres then encountered difficulties to climb anymore. According to published procedures, the pilot-in-command was supposed to initiate a turn after a course of 4 km but he continued a straight-in route until the aircraft struck the slope of a snow covered mountain located 13,4 km from the runway end. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 23 occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "It appears that the manifest was not reflecting the truth as it was mentioned a total weight of 30 tons, an incorrect value. Because the total weight was substantially above the MTOW, the climb gradient was insufficient, resulting in a collision with a mountain that the crew was unable to locate due to the low visibility caused by night. It was also reported that the crew failed to follow the published departure procedures. "}
