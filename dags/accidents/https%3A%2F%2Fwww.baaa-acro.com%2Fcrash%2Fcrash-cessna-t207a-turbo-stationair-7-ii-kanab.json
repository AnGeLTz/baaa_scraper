He leveled off and reduced to cruise power. He said he was \"preparing to make switch from left to right tank....just before I could make the switch, the engine lost power.\" He attempted to switch tanks and restart the engine, but could not get a restart. He performed a forced landing to a dirt road. During the landing roll, the left wing struck a tree and the airplane rotated 180 degrees. The engine was torn from the mount, both wing spars were bent, and the empennage sustained substantial damage. A salvage team member noted, during the airplanes recovery, that there were approximately 10 to 15 gallons of fuel in the left tank; he said the right fuel tank was empty.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate fuel consumption planning, and the subsequent fuel starvation, which resulted in a loss of engine power.
