Fourteen minutes later, the crew encountered low visibility due to clouds. At an altitude of 3,000 feet, the crew increased power on both engines to gain height but the aircraft hit trees and crashed in flames in a wooded area. All 19 passengers and the stewardess were injured while all three crew members were killed as the cockpit was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the aircraft striking high ground whilst flying in cloud at a height of approximately 3,000 feet was that:\r\na) The pilot failed to follow the track specified in his flight plan and deviated about nine miles to port of the correct track. This deviation was either deliberate or due to an error in navigation. \r\nb) The pilot failed to comply with the visual flight rules' requirements, thus violating the conditions of his flight clearance."}
