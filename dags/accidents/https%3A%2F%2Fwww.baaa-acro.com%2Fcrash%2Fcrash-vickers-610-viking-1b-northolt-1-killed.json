A second and a third attempt to land were aborted few minutes later. During the fourth attempt, the aircraft was too low and hit tree tops before crashing in a field located 4 km short of the runway threshold. 17 occupants were injured while a passenger was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was due to the aircraft flying into trees in conditions of poor visibility while the pilot was attempting a visual or bad weather timed approach (or circuit) to the airport. The pilot committed an error of judgement in not asking for diversion to another airport after he had failed to land by the aid of the Beam. An incorrect altimeter setting cannot be dismissed as a possible contributory cause."}
