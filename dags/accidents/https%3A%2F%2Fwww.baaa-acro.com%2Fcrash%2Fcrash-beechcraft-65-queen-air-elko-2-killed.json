On final the aircraft rolled inverted and descended nose down into a residence. Engine examination revealed a failed supercharger intermediate drive shaft gear resulting in loss of supercharger on the right engine. The aircraft was approximately 300 lbs over max gross weight. The landing gear was down and the flaps were extended approx 20\u00b0. The left throttle was found in the full forward (high power) position. The right prop control was in full decrease rpm, high pitch and the right engine magneto switches were off. Witnesses had observed the aircraft descend to below traffic pattern altitude. At approx 200 feet agl a loud engine noise was heard and the slow flying aircraft pitched up, rolled right and descended vertically about 1/2 mile from the airport. The pilot had not declared an emergency or defined his problem. The pilot's last recorded flight in the Beech 65 was in February 1988. There was no record of a check-out or flight training in the aircraft. Both occupants were killed.
