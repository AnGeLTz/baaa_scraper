Shortly after, it impacted the surface of the lake in a left wing low attitude with considerable slip to the left. Reports describing the noises coming from the engine immediately before impact, are conflicting. Examination of the propeller indicated there was little or no power being developed at impact. Engine examination indicated it capable of producing power at impact. (lp 233/83 refers). The aircraft was fitted with an external fuel tank underneath the fuselage, but the log books and the weight and balance did not reflect this addition.
