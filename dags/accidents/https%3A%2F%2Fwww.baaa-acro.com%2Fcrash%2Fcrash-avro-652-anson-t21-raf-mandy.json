Shortly after takeoff, while climbing to a height of some 400 feet and at a speed of 85 knots with the right engine off (simulating an engine failure with the propeller feathered), the crew was unable to maintain a correct rate of climb. In such conditions, the pilot-in-command decided to attempt an emergency landing. The twin engine aircraft belly landed in a field located 2,5 miles southwest of the airbase, near Little Cawthorpe. Both pilots were slightly injured and the aircraft was written off. ", "probable_cause": null}
