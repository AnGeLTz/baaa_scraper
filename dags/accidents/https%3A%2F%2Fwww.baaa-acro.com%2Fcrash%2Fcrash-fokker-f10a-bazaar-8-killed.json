At 1022LT, the copilot reported his position south of Emporia. At this time, weather conditions were poor with snow falls, drizzle, icing conditions, clouds and mist. The three engine airplane started to lose altitude then entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in an open field. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and all eight occupants were killed, among them the US football player and trainer Knute Rockne. \r\nCrew:\r\nRobert Fry, captain,\r\nJesse Mathias, copilot.\r\nPassengers:\r\nKnute Kenneth Rockne,\r\nH. J. Christiansen, \r\nJ. H. Hooper, \r\nW. B. Miller,\r\nF. Goldthwaite,\r\nC. A. Lobrech.", "probable_cause": "The right wing severed in flight, maybe following an excessive ice accumulation. The aircraft was probably in a spiral dive when it broke up. An excessive speed almost certainly was a contributory cause of the accident, probably not through control mishandling but through flutter. By late June 1931, 20 of the 36 grounded F-10As were back in service, and five others would follow. There was no rejoicing."}
