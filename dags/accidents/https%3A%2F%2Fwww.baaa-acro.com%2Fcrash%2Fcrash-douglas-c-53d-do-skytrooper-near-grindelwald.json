One hour after the accident, the crew (who thought he crashed in the French Alps), sent a message that was received by ATC in Paris-Orly Airport and Istres-Le Tub\u00e9 Airbase as well. French authorities made some calculation and deduced that the aircraft has crashed in the Swiss Alps and informed the Swiss authorities. Two days later, an officer based in the control tower of the Meiringen airbase located about 12 km north of the crash site received a message on his frequency as well and gave the alert. Skiers, helped with the crew of a RAF Lancaster and a USAAF B-29 were able to located the wreckage five days later.
