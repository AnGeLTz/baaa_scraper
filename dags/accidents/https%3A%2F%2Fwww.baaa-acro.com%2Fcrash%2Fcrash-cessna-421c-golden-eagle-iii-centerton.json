While making an entry on a trip sheet, he felt a bump and noted that the aircraft had started to descend. He disengaged the autopilot and the nose pitched down violently. Reducing power had an adverse effect, so he increased power again. He finally leveled the aircraft just prior to impacting in a field at cruise power. The elevator trim tab cables were found to have been crossed between the tab actuator and the pulley in the tail cone. The tab was also found fully trimmed nose down. The aircraft had just been given an annual inspection during which the elevator trim actuator had been removed, inspected and lubricated. This was the first flight since the inspection. All eight occupants escaped with minor injuries. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: climb - to cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
