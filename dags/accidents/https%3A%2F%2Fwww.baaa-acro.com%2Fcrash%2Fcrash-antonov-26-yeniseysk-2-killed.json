The approach was initiated by night and poor weather conditions with limited visibility due to snow falls. On final, approach lights were turned on when the crew saw trees. The captain decided to gain height and increased engine power when the airplane struck trees located on the top of a hill, stalled and crashed in a wooded area located 105 meters to the right of the inner marker and 1,140 meters from the runway threshold. Two crew members were killed while five other occupants were injured. The aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the navigator, the radio operator and the mechanic were intoxicated at the time of the accident. The flight engineer and the navigator failed to follow the approach procedures, probably due to the influence of alcohol. The navigator failed to maintain the calculated rate of descent and altitude, failed to report about what has been achieved in terms of visibility CDF earth landmarks. The mechanic failed to report the airspeed and the altitude in reference of the radio altimeter until 60 meters above the ground. Poor crew coordination and the fact that the captain failed to initiate a go-around procedure were considered as contributing factors. "}
