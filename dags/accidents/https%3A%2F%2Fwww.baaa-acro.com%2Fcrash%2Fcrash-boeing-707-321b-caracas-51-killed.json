", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the crew suffered an optical illusion, confounding the lights of the city of Maiquet\u00eda with the airport lights. This probably engaged the crew in a premature descent, causing the aircraft to crash into the sea. The lack of visibility was a probable contributing factor. "}
