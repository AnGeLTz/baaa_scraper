The aircraft swerved off the left side of the runway colliding with a drainage ditch and coming to rest inverted. Examination of the fuel control unit revealed that the bellows within the assembly were found in an extended position, indicating a leak into the evacuated area. A failure was noted at the seam in the bellows. In addition, examination of the propeller revealed that the start locks were engaged and the blades were at the start lock position at impact. In order to engage the start locks, the power lever has to be moved to reverse during shutdown with the engine rpm below 50%. After engine start the pilot must again retard the power levers to reverse to disengage the start locks. The locks will not disengage after the power lever is set to the flight range.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power(partial) - mechanical failure/malfunction\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - roll/run\r\nFindings\r\n1.
