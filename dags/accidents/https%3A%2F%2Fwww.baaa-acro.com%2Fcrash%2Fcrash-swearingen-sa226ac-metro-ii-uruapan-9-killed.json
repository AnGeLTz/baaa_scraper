ATC instructed the crew to carry out an instrument approach but the pilots insisted for a visual approach to runway 02. Because the crew was unable to establish a visual contact with the runway, he decided to initiate a go-around procedure, completed a right turn and attempted a second approach few minutes later that was also abandoned for the same reasons. This time, the captain initiated a turn to the left in an attempt to make a visual approach to runway 20, which was non compliant with the published procedures. Shortly later, while at an altitude of 1,200 metres, the twin engine aircraft struck the slope of a mountain located 5,9 km northwest of the airport. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact and all nine occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the crew to comply with the approach and go-around published procedures. The lack of visibility due to the night and rain was considered as a contributing factor. "}
