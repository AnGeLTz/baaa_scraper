Few debris were found off Montauk Point and all six crew members have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, it is believed that the loss of control occurred while the crew was preparing to shut down an engine to simulate a failure or was initiating a particular flying configuration requiring the deployment of the flaps at an angle of 30 \u00b0 which was the case when the aircraft struck the water surface. The assumption that two of the four engines were inoperative at the time of impact is not ruled out."}
