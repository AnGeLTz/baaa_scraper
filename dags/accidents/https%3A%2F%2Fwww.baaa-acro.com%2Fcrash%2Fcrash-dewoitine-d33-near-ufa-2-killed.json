A first attempt was made last 14 of July but the aircraft crashed in Sherbati, Russia. While cruising east of Ufa, over the Ural Mountains, the crew encountered problems while flying in poor weather conditions. Marcel Doret asked his colleagues to take their parachute and bail out. He bailed out few seconds later and landed safely when the aircraft crashed and was destroyed. At this time, he realized his both friends remained in the cabin and did not bail out for unknown reasons. Both aviators Joseph Le Brix et Ren\u00e9 Mesmin were killed. ", "probable_cause": null}
