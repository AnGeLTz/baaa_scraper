The coordinates used by the pilot were insufficient for the purpose and resulted in him landing on an incorrect aerodrome. During the take-off from the incorrect runway, the pilot apparently failed to do a proper assessment of the wind conditions and the result was an aborted take-off as the aircraft failed to gain height. During the landing following the aborted take-off, the aircraft collided with a huge rock, a telephone pole and the associated telephone wires and a 4 ft wire fence. The aircraft sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence and stopped a mere 5 metres from high tension wires  across the dirt road.", "probable_cause": "The pilot failed to carry out a proper assessment of the wind conditions. The aircraft failed to gain height as a result of a possible down draft and collided with obstacles on the ground after landing. The pilot failed to maintain directional control after take-off, resulting in a landing on the left side of the runway after aborting the take-off."}
