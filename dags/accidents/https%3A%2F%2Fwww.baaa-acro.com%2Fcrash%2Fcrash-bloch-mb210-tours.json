After landing, the instructor realized that the remaining distance was insufficient so he decided to take off and increased engine power. The airplane failed to respond and did not take off. To avoid any collision with the Air Touraine's hangars, the pilot elected to pass between both of them but both wings collided with hangars and the aircraft came to rest. All five occupants escaped uninjured except the captain. Two people on the ground were injured as well. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": null}
