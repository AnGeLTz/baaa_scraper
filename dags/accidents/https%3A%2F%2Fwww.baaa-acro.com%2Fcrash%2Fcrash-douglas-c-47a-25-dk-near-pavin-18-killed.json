Less than two hours into the flight, the crew contacted R\u00edo Cuarto and was informed about poor weather at destination. Despite conditions below minima, the pilot decided to start an IFR descent when the airplane struck the slope of a mountain and disintegrated on impact, killing all 18 occupants. ", "probable_cause": "The decision of the pilot to descend en route, without justifiable reason, below the minimum altitude prescribed for a night flight, and in weather conditions which made it his duty to follow IFR procedure a contributing cause probably being an error between control tower and aircraft in the transmission or interpretation of barometric pressure of QFE and QNH values."}
