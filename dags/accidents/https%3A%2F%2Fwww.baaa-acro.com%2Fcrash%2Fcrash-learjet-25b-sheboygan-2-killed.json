The captain occupied the right seat to allow the copilot to fly the short repositioning flight from the left. The airplane lifted off prematurely and remained in ground effect. Roll attitude vacillated slightly before onset of a rapid right roll to inverted at ground impact. The engines continued to run after impact; both were selected to high power. No material or mechanical discrepancy was found which diminished power or aircraft control. Both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The copilot's premature liftoff and the captain's inadequate remedial action resulting in loss of aircraft control at low altitude."}
