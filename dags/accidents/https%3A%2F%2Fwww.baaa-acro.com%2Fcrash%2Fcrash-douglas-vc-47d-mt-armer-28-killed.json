While approaching Phoenix from the northeast at an altitude of 8,000 feet, the pilot received the permission to descent to 6,000 feet when ATC requested his position in relation to Mt White Tank. The pilot said he overflew this mountain five minutes ago but the controller was convinced this was not the case. While cruising in marginal weather conditions, the aircraft hit the slope of a peak located in the Armer mountain range, about 66 miles northeast of Williams AFB. The wreckage was found two days later 100 feet from the summit and all 28 occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nMaj Lester Carlson, pilot,\r\n1st Lt Walter Boback, copilot,\r\nSgt Jeane Garafalo  1. \r\nPassengers:\r\nWilliam Pedrick, \r\nHilmar G.
