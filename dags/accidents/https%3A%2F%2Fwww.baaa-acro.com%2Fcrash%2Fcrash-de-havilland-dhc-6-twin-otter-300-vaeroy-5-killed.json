The aircraft was destroyed and all five occupants were killed. When the crew started to roll at the airport, the wind was gusting to 57 knots which was 7 knots above the maximum allowable limit for ground operations. After takeoff, the aircraft encountered wind gusting to 34 knots which was 14 knots above the maximum allowable limit for flight operations. Excessive wind component caused the stabilizers/elevator to fail, causing the aircraft to enter an uncontrolled descent and to crash in the sea.", "probable_cause": "The cause of the accident was that the plane during departure came into the wind that exceeded the aircraft's design criteria. Thus there was a break in the horizontal stabilizer / elevator which meant that the plane could no longer be controlled."}
