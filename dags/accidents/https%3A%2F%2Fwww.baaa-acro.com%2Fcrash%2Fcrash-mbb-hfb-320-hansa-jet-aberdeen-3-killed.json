The aircraft was observed running off the end of runway 17, which is 3,860 feet long, where it struck a fence, ditch, road and another ditch then became airborne, the landing gear separated during the above sequence. The aircraft was than observed to level off momentarily, then descend in a right turn until impact. Investigation revealed the crew had been flying 12 hours except for refueling stops and cargo loading. In addition, calculations revealed the aircraft was over gross weight by approx 1 ton. The proper runway for takeoff was 13 (40\u00b0 chance) and 6,900 feet long. Runway used was restricted to aircraft less than 12,500 gto weight. N127MW weighed over 20,000 lbs.
