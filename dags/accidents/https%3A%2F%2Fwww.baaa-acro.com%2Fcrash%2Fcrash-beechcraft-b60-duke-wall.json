Pilot stated that left engine, then right engine surged and quit as he was leveling off at 9,000 feet msl. At the time of the engine failures the fuel totalizer was reading 60 gallons, but the aircraft fuel gauges were reading empty. Pilot broke out of overcast at 3,500 msl (about 1,200 feet agl) and was unable to find a suitable clear area to land before committing to an emergency landing in trees. Gear was down, flaps were up and neither engine was feathered at impact. Pilot stated that he knew he was out of gas when both engines quit and that he did not attempt an air start.
