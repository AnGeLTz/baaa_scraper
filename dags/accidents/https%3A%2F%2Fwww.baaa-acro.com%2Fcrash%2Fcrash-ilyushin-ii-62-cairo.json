All 59 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. It was determined that the crew was scheduled to land at Cairo International Airport runway 34 but following a poor flight preparation and several mistakes on approach, the crew descended to Almaza Airport instead of the international airport. At the time of the accident, the first portion of 650 meters of runway 34 at International Airport were closed to traffic due to repair. Thinking they were landing on the right airport, the crew landed at Almaza runway 36 700 meters past its threshold. In such conditions, the airplane was unable to stop within the remaining distance of runway 36 (1,890 meters), which is a relative short for such aircraft type.   ", "probable_cause": "Crew error. "}
