After takeoff, the aircraft entered a slight left turn. Subsequently, it hit the top of a tall pine tree, about 80 feet agl and 202 feet left of the runway centerline. The aircraft then crashed into other trees after traveling about an additional 450 feet. No preimpact mechanical problem was found during the investigation. The investigation did not determine which pilot was actually flying the aircraft. Toxicology checks showed the owner had a blood/alcohol level of 0.41\u2030 (41 mg/dl) and a urine/alcohol level of 0.12\u2030 (12 mg/dl). Toxicology checks of the professional pilot's blood and urine were negative for alcohol. All five occupants were killed.

Related factors were: weather conditions, dark night, lack of runway edge lights, lack of visual perception by the pilot(s), and trees beside the runway."}
