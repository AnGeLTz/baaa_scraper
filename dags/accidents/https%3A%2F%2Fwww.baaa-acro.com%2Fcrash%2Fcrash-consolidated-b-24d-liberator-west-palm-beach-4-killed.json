En route, the aircraft collided with a Pennsylvania Central Air Lines DC-3 flying from Miami to Savannah on behalf of the USAAF. Registered NC21788, the DC-3-313 was carrying four people (two crew and two passengers). Both aircraft crashed into the sea, less than one mile from each other, and the wreckage were found some 6 miles southeast of Lake Worth. All eight occupants on both aircraft were killed. \n", "probable_cause": "Investigations determined that both aircraft were flying face to face at the altitude of 1,500 feet when the collision occurred. It appears that both crews did not realize the presence of each other because their attention was focused on cockpit duties and workload."}
