Following an uneventful flight, the crew was cleared to descend and to land at Lubumbashi-Luano Airport. After landing on runway 07, the crew started the braking procedure. At a speed of 80 knots, the aircraft deviated to the left. It veered off runway and while contacting soft ground, the nose gear collapsed. The airplane came to rest in a grassy area along the left shoulder of the runway after a course of about 200 metres. All six occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The following factors were identified:\r\n- Reduction of simulator training hours for economic reasons for someone who has never performed the duties of controlling an aircraft on the ground.\r\n- The runway shoulders at Lubumbashi (Luano) do not have the same characteristics with regard to strength (see Annex 14 and Document 9157 Part 3).\r\nIn conclusion, the actions taken on the rudder before it became ineffective must have been the cause of the aircraft's deviation from the runway centreline and the loss of control of the aircraft (LOC-G)."}
