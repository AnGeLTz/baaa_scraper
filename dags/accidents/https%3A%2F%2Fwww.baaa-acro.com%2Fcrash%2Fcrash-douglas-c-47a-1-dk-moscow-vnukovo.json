Shortly after takeoff, the crew voluntarily shot down an engine for training purposes. As he was unable to restart the engine, the captain decided to return to Vnukovo. On final, probably due to a wrong approach configuration, the aircraft landed long and after touchdown, the captain decided to go around. But the aircraft went out of control, veered off runway, collided with a parked Bell P-39Q Airacobra before coming to rest in flames 85 meters further on. All five crew members were unhurt while both aircraft were destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": null}
