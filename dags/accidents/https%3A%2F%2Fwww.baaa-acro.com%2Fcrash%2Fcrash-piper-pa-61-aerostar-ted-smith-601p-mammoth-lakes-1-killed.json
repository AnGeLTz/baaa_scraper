A notam had been filed with the Fresno FSS by the Mammoth Lakes Airport Manager at 0900 hours for taxi and runway snow removal. The pilot was aware of the notam because the manager and a lineman both said they advised him of it. Several witnesses saw the pilot enter the aircraft after declining engine pre-heat or aircraft de-icing. When advised by the lineman that the 2 qts of oil that the pilot requested did not 'register on the dipstick.' The pilot ordered another qt to be 'thrown' in and 'hurry up.' No preflight or warm up or before takeoff check was noted by observers. Turning immediately onto the runway and rolling for takeoff the pilot passed a snow plow. The aircraft used 7,000 feet (all of the runway) and left the ground in a nose high attitude. The airport elevation is 7,128 feet msl. The aircraft first struck a dirt mound 3/4 of a mile after takeoff. After maintaining further flight for approximately 280 feet which crossed a small ravine the aircraft collided with the far side of the ravine and started to break apart, stopping 144 feet further east. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
