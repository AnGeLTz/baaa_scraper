The crew made a left turn heading 060\u00b0 and continued the descent after passing 2,000 feet when the aircraft struck the ground and crashed about 33 km from the airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 33 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain after the crew continued the descent below 2,000 feet until the aircraft impacted ground.
