While returning to his base at Kaliningrad-Khrabrovo Airport, the crew failed to set the altimeter properly, causing the aircraft to approach the land at an insufficient altitude. In low clouds, the pilot-in-command did not realize his altitude was too low when the airplane struck trees, lost height and crashed in flames 200 meters further onto a school. The airplane was totally destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire as well as the school building. All eight occupants on board the aircraft were killed as well as 27 people on the ground, 23 children and three adults. Two other children were seriously injured.
