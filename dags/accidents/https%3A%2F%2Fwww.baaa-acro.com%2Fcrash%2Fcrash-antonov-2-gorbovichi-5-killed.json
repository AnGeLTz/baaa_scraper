While cruising west of Kiev at an altitude of 1,000 meters in good weather conditions, the aircraft went out of control, lost several pieces and went into a dive. At a height of 50 meters, three crew members bailed out and the aircraft crashed at an angle of descent of 35 to 40\u00b0 in a field located in Gorbovichi, about 24 km west of Kiev. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact, several debris were scattered on a large area and all five crew members were killed. Unfortunately, the three crew members who bailed out were also killed as the distance with the ground was insufficient. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the loss of control was due to the failure of the wings' structure and several other parts of the fuselage due to a faulty design of the aircraft and unacceptable manufacturing defaults.
