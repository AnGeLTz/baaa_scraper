The visibility was limited by night and poor weather conditions. In heavy rain falls, the captain realized that all conditions were not met to land and decided to initiate a go-around. Following a short holding pattern, he started the approach to runway 07. The aircraft landed 300 metres past the runway threshold. On a wet runway surface, the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance, overran and came to rest in a ravine. Due to torrential rain, all 39 occupants preferred to stay in the aircraft and were evacuated few dozen minutes later only. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The crew adopted a wrong approach configuration, causing the aircraft to land 300 metres past the runway threshold, reducing the landing distance available. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- All conditions were not met for a safe landing, \r\n- Wet runway surface,\r\n- Poor braking action,\r\n- Poor weather conditions, \r\n- Limited visibility, \r\n- Aquaplaning, \r\n- Poor flight and approach planning.
