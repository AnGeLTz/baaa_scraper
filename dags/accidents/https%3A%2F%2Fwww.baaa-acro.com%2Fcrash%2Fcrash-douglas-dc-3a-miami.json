The instructor took control but felt resistance on the controls from the student. He then reduced power on both engines and the reapplied power at which time he felt both engines come up to power. At this point, the left wing caught scrub trees 90 feet to the left of the runway.", "probable_cause": "Non mechanical partial loss of engine power during takeoff due to improper use of the throttle/power control on part of the dual student. The following findings were reported:\r\n- Inadvertent ground loop/swerve, \r\n- Directional control not maintained by dual student, \r\n- Relinquishing of control not performed by dual student, \r\n- Inadequate supervision on part of the pilot-in-command (CFI),\r\n- Ground collision with object,\r\n- Trees."}
