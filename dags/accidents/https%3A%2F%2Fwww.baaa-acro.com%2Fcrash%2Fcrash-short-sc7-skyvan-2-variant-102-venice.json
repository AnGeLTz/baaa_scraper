On approach, the visibility decreased due to foggy conditions and the pilot-in-command continued the descent at a too high speed, causing the airplane to land at an IAS of 100 knots instead of 70 knots as prescribed. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran, lost its undercarriage and plunged into the sea. All three crew members were injured and the aircraft was destroyed as the right wing was torn off. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration. "}
