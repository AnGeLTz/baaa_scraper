The pilot followed the emergency procedures and advanced the power levers to bring power back to the engine. The pilot then noticed the engine failed and had insufficient altitude to get an air restart. The subsequent descent resulted in contact with trees off the end of the airport runway. The descent was not arrested and the aircraft struck the terrain and flipped inverted. Examination of the aircraft's left engine revealed foreign contamination of the fuel control governor by air restrictor. Static testing revealed significant malfunctioning at the idle and max governoring speed limits. All three occupants were injured.
