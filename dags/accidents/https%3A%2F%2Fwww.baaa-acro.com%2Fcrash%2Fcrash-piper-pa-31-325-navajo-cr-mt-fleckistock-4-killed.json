Despite marginal weather conditions, the crew decided to file a VFR flight plan. Twelve minutes later, following a normal climb, the crew leveled off at 11,000 feet. While cruising in clouds, the crew failed to realize his altitude was insufficient when the right wing struck the west face of Mt Fleckistock (3,417 meters high) located to the west of Wassen, Uri. Out of control, the airplane descended until it crashed in a snow covered area. The wreckage was found two days later, on April 2. The aircraft was destroyed and tree dead bodies were found. The body of a pilot was never found. ", "probable_cause": "The crew was flying at an altitude that failed to provide a sufficient vertical separation with the upper limit of the clouds and failed to see and avoid the mountains while flying under VFR mode in clouds.
