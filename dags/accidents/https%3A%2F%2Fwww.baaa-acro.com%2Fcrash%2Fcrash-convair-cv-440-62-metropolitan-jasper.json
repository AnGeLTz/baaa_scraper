The aircrew retarded the right throttle and reduced the right engine to 2,100 rpm by using the prop increase/decrease toggle switch. The aircrew were unable to feather the right propeller or maintain altitude, so they diverted to the nearest airport (Walker County). While turning downwind for runway 09, the right engine fire indicator activated and the copilot confirmed a fire. Both fire bottles were discharged and the right propeller stopped rotating. Injection water for the left engine was exhausted and the left engine began backfiring. The captain then maneuvered and landed on runway 27. After touchdown, the right main tires failed, the aircraft veered off the right side of the runway and hit a ditch and the gear collapsed. An exam revealed the #6 cylinder link rod and/or piston in the right engine had failed, resulting in further damage to the engine and #6 cylinder. Subsequently, fire and heat caused the right engine to seize and also damaged the right main tires which failed at touchdown. All 39 occupants were evacuated, among them two passengers were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power\r\nPhase of operation: cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
