En route, while flying in marginal weather conditions with limited visibility due to fog, the aircraft struck the slope of a mountain located south of the Salang Pass. The crew of an ISAF helicopter localized the wreckage 3 days later in a snow covered area at an altitude of 4,270 metres. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 44 occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain after the crew continued the descent despite he was instructed by ATC to maintain his actual altitude. Poor visibility due to heavy fog was a contributing factor, as well as a non reaction of the crew regarding the GPWS alarm, due to a misunderstanding by the crew, either due to language problems or because of previous false alerts.
