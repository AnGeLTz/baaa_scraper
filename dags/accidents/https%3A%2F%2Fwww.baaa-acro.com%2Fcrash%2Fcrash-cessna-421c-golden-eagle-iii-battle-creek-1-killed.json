Witnesses reported that they heard the engines operating before the plane crashed. During an investigation, no mechanical anomalies of the airplane were found. The pilot of a Boeing 727 reported that his airplane accumulated a 'quick load' of ice during his descent to land at the same airport within an hour of the accident. \n", "probable_cause": "The pilot's decision to fly in adverse weather (icing) conditions; the accumulation of airframe ice; and the pilot's failure to maintain adequate airspeed for the situation, which resulted in a loss of aircraft control. The icing condition was a related factor. "}
