On final approach to Zvartnots Airport, at a speed of 180-190 km/h, the aircraft became unstable, lost height and struck the ground about 150 metres short of runway threshold with a positive acceleration of 4 g and crashed. All eight occupants escaped with minor injuries and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of the combination of the following factors: \r\n- Poor approach planning, \r\n- The crew failed to follow the approach pattern,\r\n- Lack of captain's experience, \r\n- The aircraft was unstable on approach, \r\n- No corrective action on part of the crew, \r\n- The crew positioned the throttle below flight idle, causing negative thrust and a loss of ground speed and altitude, \r\n- Shortcomings in crew interactions expressed in the absence of control by the copilot about the throttle position during the late stage of flight,\r\n- Failure of the crew to initiate a go-around procedure."}
