The cause of this could not be specified due to lack of evidence due to the destruction of the wreck. Certain facts for which a specific explanation could not be found were: \r\n- Extension of the duration of the flight,\r\n- Radio silence,\r\n- Stopping of engine number four, \r\n- Pitch of the propeller on engine three.\r\nAbove all these findings, it was established that the crew was flying at low height few minutes before the accident according to the testimony of farmer. The reason for this could not be determined with certainty. "}
