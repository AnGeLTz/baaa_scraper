The aircraft carried a two-pilot crew, and there was no cargo on board. The aircraft proceeded direct to Bathurst at 8,000 feet above sea level (asl) and at 1820 AST was cleared by Moncton Area Control Centre (ACC) for an approach at Bathurst. The co-pilot contacted the Bathurst UNICOM and advised the operator that the crew would be flying the non-directional beacon/distance measuring equipment (NDB/DME) runway 10 approach. During the non-precision instrument approach to runway 10, the aircraft struck trees .75 nautical miles (nm) inside the Bathurst beacon and 3.75 nm from the airport. The accident occurred at approximately 1845 AST, during the hours of darkness in instrument meteorological conditions, at an elevation of 450 feet asl. Both pilots were killed.
