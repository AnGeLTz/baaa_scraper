About an hour into the flight, while cruising over the El Cocuy National Park, the aircraft encountered unfavorable currents, lost height and crashed in an isolated and mountainous area located about 45 km west of Tame. The wreckage was found on 12 April 1999 and all eight occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Possible loss of control of the aircraft due to the presence of strong air currents or windshear, accompanied by extreme turbulences that caused the aircraft to lose height and struck the ground. Inadequate planning of the en route flight, overflying the mountain range apparently with the purpose of performing the operation in less time."}
