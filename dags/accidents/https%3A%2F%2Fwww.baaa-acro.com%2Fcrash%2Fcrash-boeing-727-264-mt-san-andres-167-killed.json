While cruising at the assigned altitude of 31,000 feet, an explosion occurred on the left main gear wheel well after a tire burst. Fuel and hydraulic lines were ruptured and electrical cables severed, causing a cabin decompression. The captain declared an emergency and elected to reduce his altitude when the aircraft caught fire after fuel ignited. The aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed on the slope of Mt San Andr\u00e9s (3,569 meters high) located 18 km southwest of Maravatio, State of Michoac\u00e1n. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 167 occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the left main gear brake was overheated during the takeoff run. This allowed a tire to explode due to high temperature and pressure because it has been serviced with air rather than nitrogen."}
