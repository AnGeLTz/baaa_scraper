On final approach to runway 15, the aircraft has been observed to be flying more slowly than usual and at a low height. The turn on to final approach developed into a spin to the left, and after two or three rotations, the aircraft crashed into a wood an caught fire. Both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It is concluded that the aircraft entered the spin from an accelerated stall, possibly as the result of the pilot attempting to regain the approach centre line by a higher rate or turn than normal. The relatively slow speed of the aircraft, the gusty conditions and the handling characteristics associated with the aircraft's modified flap system are considered to have been contributory factors.
