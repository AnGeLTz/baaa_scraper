During a night arrival, the pilot began a VOR-A approach in IMC, then he reported a problem with his avionics and elected to make a missed approach. During the missed approach, he said that he 'lost' an inverter, then reported the gyros were inoperative. Radar vectors were being provided when he stated 'we have big trouble here.' Soon thereafter, radar and radio contacts were lost and the aircraft crashed approximately 7 miles southeast of the airport. During impact, the aircraft made a deep crater and was demolished. No preimpact engine or airframe failure was found. An investigation revealed the #2 (copilot's) attitude indicator was inoperative on the previous flight. A discrepancy report was taken to the avionics department, but the requested entry was not made in the aircraft form-4. The pilot took off before corrective action was taken. The operations manual requested 1,000 hours multi-engine time as pic and training by esignated cfi's. The pilot had approximately 837 hours multi-engine time, recorded 9 training flights in N6858S with non-designated instructors, completed a part 135 flight check on 2/17/88. Both occupants were killed. \n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: airframe/component/system failure/malfunction\r\nPhase of operation: approach\r\nFindings\r\n1.
