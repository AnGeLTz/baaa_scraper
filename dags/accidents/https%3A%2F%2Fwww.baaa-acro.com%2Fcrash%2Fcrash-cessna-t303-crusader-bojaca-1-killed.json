The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and the pilot was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain after the decision of the pilot to continue the flight under VFR mode in IMC conditions. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- The pilot took the decision to continue the flight to destination instead of returning to Flandes (Girardot) or to divert to the alternate airport, \r\n- A low situational awareness on part of the pilot who failed to take into account the geographical environment and to maintain a safe separation from the terrain."}
