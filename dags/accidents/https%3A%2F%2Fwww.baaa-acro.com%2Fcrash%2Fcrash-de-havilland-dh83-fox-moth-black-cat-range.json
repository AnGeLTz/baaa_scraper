", "probable_cause": "Pilot's accident report to DCA: \"I tried to regain height after a downdraft by zig-zagging up the valley because there was not enough room to turn. I had full throttle, the trees were getting closer and closer and the nose higher and higher until the machine stalled. I throttled back and hoped for the best. I hit the trees and got out. I walked to the river but there was a big waterfall which I could not get up, so I walked down the river in the other direction.\""}
