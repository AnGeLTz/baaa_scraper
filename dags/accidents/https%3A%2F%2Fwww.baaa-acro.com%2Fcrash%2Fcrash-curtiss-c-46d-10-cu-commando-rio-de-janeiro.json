On approach, the instructor decided to perform a single engine landing and shot down one engine. For unknown reason, the airplane landed hard on one wheel and bounced. The instructor also noted that another airplane was entering the runway so he decided to make a go around and increased power on the second engine. Few seconds later, while in initial climb, the second engine lost power. The airplane lost speed, stalled and hit the mast of a boat before crashing into the Guanabara Bay. Both pilots were rescued while the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": null}
