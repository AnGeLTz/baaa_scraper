The crew shut down the left engine and started the approach to runway 22. But on final, he realized he could reach the airport so he completed a belly landing one km short of runway threshold. The aircraft came to rest in a field and was damaged beyond repair. All 20 occupants escaped uninjured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the vibrations and the subsequent failure of the left engine was the consequence of a bad adjustment of the intake valves on cylinders n\u00b08 and 9, which remained stuck in open position, causing high temperature and a loss of power."}
