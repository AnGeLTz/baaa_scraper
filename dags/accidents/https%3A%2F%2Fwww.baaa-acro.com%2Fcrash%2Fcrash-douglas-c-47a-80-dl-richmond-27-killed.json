In heavy rain falls and by night, the crew missed the airport and was forced to make a go around. Few seconds later, while trying to gain height, the aircraft went out of control and crashed 6 miles south of the airfield. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 27 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The probable cause of this accident was the inability of the pilot to maintain adequate control of the aircraft to effect an emergency single-engine instrument approach under adverse weather conditions. Contributing factors were: The decision of the pilot to continue the flight into weather conditions that were considered as unsafe; the negligence of the pilot in failing to have an inspection of the aircraft engines made prior to departure from Richmond; the action of the pilot in shutting down the wrong engine when experiencing excessive vibration from a power plant; and the pilot's neglect in failing to retract the landing gear during an emergency go-around."}
