As he continued the approach, he informed the controller he would be unable to go around since the hydraulic system was powered by the affected right engine. Subsequently, the pilot said he was at 1,500 feet and was having a hard time holding altitude. A witness heard and saw the aircraft in a level attitude at low altitude, then saw the aircraft dive toward the ground. It impacted in a steep descent just short of a long field and burned. The right propeller was feathered, but there was no evidence of oil starvation in either engine. The pilot's neighbor said he (the pilot) was aware of a hydraulic leak, but he was awaiting the annual inspection (due in September) to repair it. An exam revealed the flaps were partially extended, the landing gear control was in the 'up' position, and the gear was down. The flight manual stated that with a hydraulic failure downstream of the accumulator, the flap handle should be in 'neutral' to prevent gear and flap extension. The flap control could not be found. All six occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: airframe/component/system failure/malfunction\r\nPhase of operation: descent - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
