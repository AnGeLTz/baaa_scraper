In the course of conducting checks at an altitude of 5000 feet, the no. 2 prop did not go into full feather. It continued to windmill. The crew then decided to return to Belleville-Scott AFB, IL (BLV) immediately. The pilot requested a straight-in approach to runway 31. Engine no. 2 was shut down and the plane was configured for landing. The airplane was high on the approach so the crew executed a go around and came in for a second approach. This time the airplane was slightly high and too fast so the pilot again called for a go around. During the transition from a high rate of descent to level flight for go around, the airspeed remained around 130 knots IAS. The captain raised the flaps from 40\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 and then reached for the gear up switch. The aircraft struck the runway and slid off the end into a grassy field. A fire that ensued after impact was contained by base crash and rescue crews.\r\nSource: ASN", "probable_cause": null}
