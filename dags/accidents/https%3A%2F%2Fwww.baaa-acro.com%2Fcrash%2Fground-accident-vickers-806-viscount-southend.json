After being parked at Southend Airport for a long time without any maintenance and due to hydraulic problems, the Short 330 was taxiing when the nosewheel steering system failed and the crew lost control of the aircraft that veered to the left and collided with the parked Viscount. Both pilots on board the Short escaped uninjured and both aircraft were damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Corrosion within the emergency brake accumulator had allowed nitrogen to enter the main hydraulic system of the Short 330. In the past, the aircraft had been parked in the open for a considerable time without servicing."}
