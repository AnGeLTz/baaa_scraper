The pilot-in-command continued his route in IFR Mode at the altitude of 6,000 feet. While cruising in marginal weather conditions, the aircraft hit the slope of a mountain located near Le Mont-Dore, about 32 km southwest of Clermont-Ferrand. The airplane was destroyed upon impact and all 36 occupants were killed. It was reported that the visibility was estimated over 40 km below the cloud layer that was 6/8 at 1,000 meters. Nevertheless, the aircraft was off course to the south by 100 km at the time of the accident, probably due to strong winds. Also, the crew continued the flight at an altitude of 6,000 feet instead of the initial intended 8,000 feet. ", "probable_cause": null}
