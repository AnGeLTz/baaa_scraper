While cruising at an altitude of 20,000 feet, the left engine failed and smoke spread in the cabin. Confused and disoriented, the crew inadvertently shut down the right engine. During the descent, the crew was able to open the outflow valve, clearing the smoke. The crew then realized he could not reached the Arbil Airport so he attempted an emergency landing in a field located in Kawrgosk, about 17 km northwest of Arbil Airport. The aircraft slid on its belly for few dozen metres before coming to rest, and was damaged beyond repair. All four occupants evacuated safely. ", "probable_cause": null}
