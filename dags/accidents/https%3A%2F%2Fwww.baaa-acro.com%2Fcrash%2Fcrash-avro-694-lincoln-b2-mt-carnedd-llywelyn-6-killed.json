While approaching Anglesey from the east by night and in poor weather conditions, the aircraft hit the slope of the Mt Carnedd Llywelyn (1,064 meters high) located in the Carneddau Mountain Range, about 23,5 miles southeast of RAF Valley. The wreckage was found in the early morning and all six crew members were killed. \r\nCrew (230th OCU):\r\nS/L John T. Shore, pilot,\r\nF/Lt Cyril A. Lindsey, navigator,\r\nEng Ronald A.

Wood, air Gunner.", "probable_cause": "The subsequent Court of Inquiry determined that the likely cause was the crew had turned onto a southeasterly course over Anglesey instead of the reciprocal out to sea.
