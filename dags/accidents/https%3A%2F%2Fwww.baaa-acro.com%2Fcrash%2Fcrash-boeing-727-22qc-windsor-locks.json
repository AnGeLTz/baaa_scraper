They also observed erratic engine indications from the n\u00b03 engine. The captain aborted the takeoff and stopped the airplane on the runway. The fire warning system activated on the n\u00b03 engine after the airplane came to  rest. The crew attempted to extinguish the fire with the airplane's fire extinguishing system; however, they were unsuccessful. The post accident examination of the n\u00b03 engine revealed the high pressure compressor disk had failed due to a fatigue crack that originated from a corrosion pit. The shrapnel from the disk penetrated the engine nacelle and severed the main fuel line for the engine. The fuel ignited and burned into the fuselage, igniting the 12,600 lbs of cargo (US Mail).", "probable_cause": "A catastrophic and uncontained failure of the n\u00b03 engine which resulted in a fuel fed fire."}
