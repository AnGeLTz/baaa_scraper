After departure, the crew encountered marginal weather conditions and followed a wrong heading. In limited visibility due to low clouds, the airplane impacted the slope of Mt Mullach Buidhe (2,366 feet) located on the Isle of Arran, some 41 km northwest of the departure point. The airplane disintegrated on impact and all 22 occupants were killed, among them RAF personnel and civilians. \r\nCrew (BOAC):\r\nCpt Ernest Robert Bristow White, pilot,\r\nCpt Francis Delaforce Bradbrooke, copilot,\r\nHenry Samuel Green, radio officer.\r\nPassengers: \r\nAlbert Alexander Oliver, radio officer, \r\nGeorge Herbert Powell, radio officer, \r\nHerbert David Rees. radio officer,\r\nCpt James Josiah Anderson, \r\nRalph Bruce Brammer, radio officer, \r\nJohn Beatty Drake, radio officer, \r\nCpt Daniel Joseph Duggan, \r\nCpt George Thomas Harris, \r\nCpt Hoyt Ralph Judy, \r\nWilfrid Groves Kennedy, radio officer,\r\nCpt Watt Miller,\r\nGeorge Laing, radio officer,\r\nWilliam Kenneth Marks, radio officer,\r\nHugh Cameron McIntosh, radio officer,\r\nCpt John Evan Price,\r\nErnest George Reeves, flight engineer, \r\nF/O John James Rouleston, \r\nCpt Harold Clifford Wesley Smith,\r\nCpt Jack Wixen.\r\nMore info and photos on:\r\nhttp://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/liberator_lb-30a_buidhe.htm", "probable_cause": "The accident occurred in poor weather conditions with low visibility and the mountain was shrouded in clouds. According to the RAF investigation team, the accident was caused by a navigation error on part of the crew who followed a heading of 295\u00b0 shortly after takeoff instead of 012\u00b0. It resulted in a deviation of the airplane which was flying 15 km north of the initial track. The crew was unable to know his real position due to low visibility and the absence of ground visual references. Therefore, the accident is the result of a controlled flight into terrain. "}
