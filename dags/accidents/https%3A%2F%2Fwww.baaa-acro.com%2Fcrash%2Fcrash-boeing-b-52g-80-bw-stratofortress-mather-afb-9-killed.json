The crew started the takeoff procedure 10 seconds after a first USAF B-52 that departed the same runway. After liftoff, during initial climb, the airplane encountered wake turbulences. The pilot-in-command decided to reduce the engine power but his reaction was excessive, causing all eight engines to flame out. Due to a loss of speed, the aircraft stalled and struck the ground. It exploded on impact and debris were found on a 400 yards distance. All nine crew members were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nMaj James Henry York, pilot,\r\nCpt Lyle Allen Brunner, instructor, \r\nCpt Dennis Earl Davis, electronic warfare instructor,\r\nM/Sgt Jere E.
