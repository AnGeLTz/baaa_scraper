Paulden and Eric Morris. Witnesses stated that the engine seemed to have quit at about 1,000 feet on descent into Belmont Airport at Geelong. The aircraft evidently stalled in from some 200 feet. Paulden and Morris (popularly known as 'Exide Eric', due to his battery business) were killed. C.D. Pratt, tutor of Paulden and Morris, was flying another Moth some 30 feet above them when the accident happened (seems a little close?). Previous owners had reported the tendency for engine failure on this particular machine. \n\r\nSource: Ed Coates", "probable_cause": null}
