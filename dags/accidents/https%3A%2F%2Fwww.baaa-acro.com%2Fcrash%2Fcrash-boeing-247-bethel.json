While descending to Newark at night, the crew encountered marginal weather conditions and poor visibility due to low clouds and ground fog. Unable to locate the airport, the crew decided to fly to the north and to divert to Danbury-Tucker Field Airport. While approaching Danbury, CT, weather conditions were also marginal and the crew was unable to establish a contact with the people on duty at the airport. At that time, the airport was not illuminated. The crew followed several circuits over the area and attempted a blind landing but fuel reserves were low. On final approach, the aircraft impacted trees and crashed in a wooded area located in Bethel, some 5 km short of runway. All 12 occupants were injured and the aircraft was destroyed. \r\nCrew:\r\nJohn Wolf, pilot,\r\nLorenz Letson, copilot.\r\nAgnes Pugh, stewardess.\r\nPassengers:\r\nGeorge H.
