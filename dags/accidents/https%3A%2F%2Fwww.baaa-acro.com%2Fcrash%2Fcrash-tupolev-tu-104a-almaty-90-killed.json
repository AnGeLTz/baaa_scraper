An explosion occurred and the airplane descended at a speed of 150-190 km/h and crashed in flames in a snow covered field located 3,280 metres short of runway threshold. The aircraft was destroyed and all 90 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of a fuel line on the left engine caused the fuel to leak and to ignite while contacting hot air coming from the heating system due to a seal failure. This also resulted in a high carbon monoxide that spread in the cabin and the cockpit. Also, a fuel pump broke away. "}
