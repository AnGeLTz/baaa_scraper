", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew failed to follow the approach checklist and forgot to lower the undercarriage. The following factors were considered as contributing:\r\n- Several propeller blades detached while contacting the runway surface, causing severe damage to the fuselage,\r\n- A fire erupted following an electrical short-circuit in the cargo hold combined with a hydraulic leak, \r\n- Lack of coordination on part of the cabin crew who failed to follow the safety and evacuation procedures, \r\n- Lack of efficiency and assistance on part of the ground firefighters who arrived on the scene 15-20 minutes after the accident.
