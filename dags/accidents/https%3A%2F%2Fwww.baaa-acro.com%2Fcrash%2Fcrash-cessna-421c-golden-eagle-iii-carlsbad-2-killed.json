The airplane descended into rough, brush-covered terrain and then struck a large dirt berm, about 1-1/2 miles northeast of the departure airport. Examination of the engines did not reveal any obvious mechanical malfunction. The fuel was correct. Combustion chamber signatures indicated that the engines were operated at a lean or mild detonation condition. The flaps were extended about 30 degrees and the landing gear was retracted. The surviving passenger could not recall any dramatic engine problems, only that the airplane could not maintain altitude. The pilot and front seat passenger were not wearing shoulder harnesses.", "probable_cause": "A loss of engine power for undetermined reasons. The pilot's failure to raise the flaps and maintain altitude were factors in the accident."}
