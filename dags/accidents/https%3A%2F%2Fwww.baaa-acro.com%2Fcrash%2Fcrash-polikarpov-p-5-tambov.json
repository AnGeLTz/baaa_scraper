Weather conditions at takeoff from Penza were excellent. About 40 minutes into the flight, these conditions deteriorated with fog. The pilot elected to gain height and climbed to the altitude of 1,400 metres when he encountered icing conditions. He decided to returned to Penza and initiated a 180 turn in the clouds when he lost control of the airplane that entered a dive. At a height of 200 metres, he regained control but lost it again at a height of 100 metres before the airplane crashed near Tambov, west of Penza. Both occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control in clouds after the pilot suffered a spatial disorientation. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- The information transmitted to the pilot concerning weather conditions en route were inaccurate, \r\n- Icing conditions, \r\n- The pilot was not sufficiently trained to fly in IFR conditions.
