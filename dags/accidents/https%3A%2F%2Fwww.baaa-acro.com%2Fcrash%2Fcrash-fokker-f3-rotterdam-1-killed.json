Shortly after takeoff from Waalhaven Airport, while climbing to a height of 150 metres, the airplane stalled and crashed in the harbor of Waalhaven. A lady was killed while five other occupants were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "On its final report published in November 1928, the investigation board concluded that the accident was caused by an error committed by the pilot who initiated the rotation prematurely. During the initial climb, the speed was insufficient and the aircraft stalled and crashed due to an aerodynamic stall. In their report, investigators confirmed that the general experience of the pilot was on Fokker F7 and not Fokker F3. Thus, his inexperience on this type of aircraft as such as the decision of the Chief of Operations to schedule this pilot on this type of aircraft were considered as contributory factors. "}
