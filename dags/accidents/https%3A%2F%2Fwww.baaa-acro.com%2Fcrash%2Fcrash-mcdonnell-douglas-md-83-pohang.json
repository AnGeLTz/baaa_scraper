The captain decided to initiate a go-around procedure and started a second approach few minutes later. On approach to runway 10, the wind component changed and the crew continued the descent with a 20 knots tailwind. At an excessive speed of 158 knots, the aircraft landed 1,500 feet past the runway threshold. On a wet runway surface, the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance (runway 10 is 7,000 feet long), overran, struck a 3 metres high embankment and came to rest in a ravine, broken in two. All 156 occupants were rescued, among them 60 passengers were injured, two seriously. ", "probable_cause": "The following findings were identified:\r\n- Poor crew action during an approach in poor weather conditions, \r\n- Excessive tailwind component, \r\n- Misuse of brake and thrust reverser systems during the landing roll, about 27 seconds after touchdown only, \r\n- The crew failed to initiate a go-around procedure as the landing was obviously missed, \r\n- Poor ground assistance."}
