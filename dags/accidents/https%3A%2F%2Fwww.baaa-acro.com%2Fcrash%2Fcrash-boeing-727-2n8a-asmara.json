After touchdown on a wet runway surface, the crew started the braking procedure and the thrust reverser systems were activated. Unable to stop within the remaining distance (runway 25 is 3 km long), the aircraft overran and collided with a concrete block, causing the left main gear to be torn off. All 140 occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. At the time of the accident, wind was from 200 at 6 knots and the runway surface was wet due to recent rain falls. The exact touchdown point could not be determined and all braking systems were available and properly used after landing. The aircraft collided with a concrete block located beside a runway light just past the runway end. ", "probable_cause": null}
