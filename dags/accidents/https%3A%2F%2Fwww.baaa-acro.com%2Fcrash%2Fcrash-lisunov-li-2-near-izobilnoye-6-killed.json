After takeoff from Baku, the airplane climbed to an altitude of 2,100 meters and the crew obtained the permission to modify his route to make an intermediate stop at Rostov-on-Don before continuing to Dnipropetrovsk. Doing so, the crew failed to request information about weather conditions en route.
