About two hours into the flight, while cruising at an altitude of 330 feet, the right engine lost power then failed. While executing the emergency checklist, the left engine failed as well. The pilot attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft crashed in a wooded area, bursting into flames. Both passengers evacuated with minor injuries and the pilot was killed. The aircraft was totally destroyed by a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "There was sufficient fuel in the tanks at the time of the accident as the aircraft was refueled prior to departure for a 5-hour flight.

When the right engine failed, the pilot was flying at an altitude of 330 feet which was below the minimum safe altitude fixed at 500 feet. Also, he was apparently using his cell phone. "}
