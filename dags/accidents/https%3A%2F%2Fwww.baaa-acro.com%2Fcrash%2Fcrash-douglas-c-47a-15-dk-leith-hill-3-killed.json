After crossing The Channel and flying over England, the weather conditions worsened and the crew encountered poor visibility. The captain decided to reduce his altitude from 1,500 feet to 1,200 feet. Few seconds later, he descended 200 feet more when the aircraft struck the Leith Hill and was destroyed. Three crew members were killed while two others were injured. Two other aircraft in the formation crashed at the same time, in the same area and in similar circumstances.", "probable_cause": null}
