While the power on the left engine increased to 94,5% 11 seconds later, the power on the right engine dropped to zero. The crew elected to feather the right propeller but this was not possible. The airplane lost height, started a descent and slightly turned to the right when, at a speed of 130 km/h, it struck 20 meters high trees and crashed in a wooded area located 450 meters past the runway end. Two pilots and four passengers were killed while 12 other occupants were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the malfunction of the right engine was the consequence of a short-term failure of the rotor speed regulator, which forced the crew to shut down the engine and to feather the propeller. For unknown reasons, the propeller could not be feathered, causing drag that reduced the aircraft's speed and necessitating an emergency landing. "}
