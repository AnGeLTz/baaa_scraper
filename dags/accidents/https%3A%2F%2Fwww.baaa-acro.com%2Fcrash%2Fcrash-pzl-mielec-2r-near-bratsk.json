After 43 minutes into the flight, while cruising at an altitude of about 1,200 metres, the engine lost power and the oil temperature increased from 70\u00b0 to 150\u00b0 C. The aircraft lost height, forcing the crew to attempt an emergency landing. The aircraft hit tree tops and eventually crash landed in a wooded area located 60 km northeast of Bratsk. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and all three occupants escaped unarmed. ", "probable_cause": "The crash of An-2 RA-35141 aircraft occurred during the emergency landing on a forest firebreak. The landing was urged due to in-flight engine power loss as a result of the destruction of the 62.06.02 bronze hub pouring of the master rod big end of the crank mechanism. Most probably the destruction of the bronze hub pouring was caused by a manufacturing flaw consisting in a lack of bronze friction with the steel base on a part of its surface."}
