Several witnesses observed the airplane to the west of the airport at a low altitude, appearing to enter a turn that was followed by a \"rapid descent\" and impact with the ground. The ground scars and\r\ndamage to the airplane were consistent with a near-vertical descent and impact. An examination of the airplane and its systems revealed no preaccident anomalies. The moon was obscured by an overcast sky and dark night conditions were prevalent.", "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain aircraft control, resulting in an aerodynamic stall and spin."}
