At 0827LT, while cruising at 18,000 feet, the crew reported over Ambato. Eight minutes later, while cruising in limited visibility, the four engine airplane struck the slope of Mt Chimborazo (6,263 metres high). As the airplane failed to arrive at destination, SAR operations were initiated but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the 59 occupants was found. The wreckage was apparently localized on 17 October 2002 and a team of 20 alpinists was able to reach the crash site on 18 February 2003. Debris of the airplane were found, confirming this was flight EH232. ", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain. "}
