The aircraft then descended thru 10,500 feet and the crew reported they would maintain that altitude. At about 2301 the aircraft was about 5 miles southeast of Colorado Springs and at 10,300 feet when radar contact was lost. The aircraft crashed in that area in a near vertical descent. The outboard 8 feet of the right wing had separated in flight and impacted about 1/4 mile from the main wreckage. The right aileron had sheared in 3 pieces also and was found near the failed wing. There was evidence that the the wing had yielded to a down and up loading (1 cycle) when it separated upward and rearward. All fracture surfaces had evidence of overload failures except the aileron control linkage which was further damaged on impact and could not be evaluated. Both pilots were using medication that was contraindicated for use by airmen and both pilots had little sleep during the previous 48 hours. Before the flight the pilot seemed agitated and the copilot had an odor of beer. Both occupants were killed.
