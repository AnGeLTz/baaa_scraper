While flying at a low height against sunrise, the crew failed to see and avoid power cables. The single engine airplane collided with cables and a concrete post before crashing in a cornfield, bursting into flames. The copilot was killed and the captain was seriously injured. He died two days later from his injuries. The aircraft was destroyed by a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the accident with the An-2 RA-40851 aircraft was the collision of the aircraft with a reinforced concrete support and power transmission lines in a controlled flight while performing the aerial application at an extremely low altitude.\r\nThe contributing factors most likely were:\r\n- Field processing when the sun is less than 15\u00b0 above the horizon and the sun's heading angle is less than 30\u00b0,\r\n- Insufficient prudence of the PIC when performing a VFR flight for aerial application,\r\n- Failure of the pilot to take into account the presence of artificial obstacles in the flight area,\r\n- Lack of marking of power lines."}
