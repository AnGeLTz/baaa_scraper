NCH138 landed hard and bounced three times on the runway. According to the ATC controller, after touch down the aircraft rolled in an s-pattern before it overran the runway. NCH138 made a 180\u00b0 turn with the right engine hitting the ground. The aircraft came to a final stop on the left side and 10 m beyond the stopway. The accident occurred at night in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). The Aerodrome Rescue and Fire Fighting Service (ARFFS) arrived the scene and commenced rescue operations immediately. All occupants on board were evacuated; one passenger sustaining a minor injury.", "probable_cause": "The decision to land following an unstabilized approach (high rate of descent and high approach speed. A go-around was not initiated.\r\nContributory factors:\r\n1. The deteriorating weather conditions with a line squall prevented a diversion to the alternates.\r\n2. The runway was wet with significant patches of standing water. "}
