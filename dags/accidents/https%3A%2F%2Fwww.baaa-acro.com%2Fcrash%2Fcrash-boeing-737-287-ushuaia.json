After passing 8,000 feet on descent, the crew was cleared to land on runway 16 but the captain prefered to land on runway 34 as the last report indicated a wind from 360\u00b0 gusting at 20 knots. Therefore, the crew was informed about possible windshear on approach. At an excessive speed of 140 knots (instead of the 128 knots as prescribed), the aircraft landed hard on runway 34 (positive acceleration of 1,89 G) and bounced. Out of control, it veered off runway, went down an embankment and came to rest in the sea (about two meters of water). All 62 occupants were evacuated, among them 13 were injured. The aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who landed the aircraft at an excessive speed. The crew failed to use all available braking systems after touchdown, which was considered as a contributing factor. "}
