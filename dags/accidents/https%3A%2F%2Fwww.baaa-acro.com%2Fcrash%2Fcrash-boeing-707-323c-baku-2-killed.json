The crew decided to continue to Baku in such configuration. On approach to Baku-Bina Airport by night, the captain contacted ATC and was cleared to proceed to a low pass to check the undercarriage. Following the low pass, the crew initiated a turn to the left and followed a circuit for a second approach. While flying at a relative low altitude, all four engines suffered a loss of power. The aircraft lost height, collided with light poles on a bridge and crashed in a field located 9 km from the airport. Four crew members were seriously injured and two others were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that all four engines lost power due to low fuel. The following contributing factors were reported: \r\n- A malfunction of the landing gear retraction system, which led to fly with a landing gear extended and caused an excessive fuel consumption. The subsequent failure to lock the left landing gear in the extended position made it necessary to do a second approach with a limited amount of fuel.\r\n- The fuel gauge indicator readings were inaccurate and prevented the crew from having correct info about the amount of fuel available and applying the flight manual's recommendations for low-fuel flights.\r\n- The lack of an airline bulletin on the features of the fuel system prevented the crew in the emergency situation from selecting the optimum mode for flying with a limited amount of fuel.\r\n- Inadequate operational and maintenance organization on the part of the companies Baku Air and ALG Inc."}
