The plane was observed departing at 1550 CDT in a max performance climb. Radar info from mode C of the transponder returns indicated that the aircraft climbed from 1,000 to 16,000 feet in 7 min and 14 seconds. Level flight was indicated at 16,300 ft from 1558:16 to 1601:17 CDT. The last alt return was from 16,000 ft at 2201:07. Two more returns were received at 2201:49 and 2202:08, but with no altitude readout. At about that time, the aircraft was observed spiraling down, counterclockwise, with a portion of the left wing missing. The wing tip (outer wing panel outboard from about wing station 190), left aileron and left engine tail cone panel were found about 3 miles from the main wreckage impact point. An examination revealed that the wing panel separation occurred upward from positive overload forces. No evidence was found of fatigue or pre-existing failure. Light to moderate turbulence was reported between 14,000 and 18,000 ft msl. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
