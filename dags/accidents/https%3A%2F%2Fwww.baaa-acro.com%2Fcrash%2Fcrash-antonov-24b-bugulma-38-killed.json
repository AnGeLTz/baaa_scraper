The aircraft speed dropped and the aircraft started to veer to the left. The crew elected to maintain directional control but the speed continued to drop. At a speed of 140 km/h, the aircraft banked left to an angle of 110\u00b0 then stalled and crashed in a field located 8 km from the runway threshold and 500 meters from its extended centerline. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 38 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The left propeller autofeathered one second after the flaps were deployed in an angle of 38\u00b0 because an electrical switch connected to the automatic feathering system failed. This situation affected the aircraft stability and controllability and the crew was unable to correct abnormal yaw and roll following several errors."}
