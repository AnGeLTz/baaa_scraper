(He was a new hire, low time pilot)\r\n- Pilot\u2019s failure to conduct a proper preflight inspection of his aircraft. (did not visually check fuel tanks despite knowing that the gauges were faulty)\r\n- Pilot\u2019s complacency with documentation of defects. (Pilot never advised maintenance or management that the gauges were faulty)\r\n- Pilot\u2019s reliance on indications that he admitted were erroneous.\r\n- Pilot\u2019s lack of situational awareness.\r\n- Pilot\u2019s failure to recognize that his problem was fuel exhaustion and not engine failure and neglected to use cross-feed procedure."}
