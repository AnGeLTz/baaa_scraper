Following a successful landing at Farnborough, and discussions with the aircraft's maintenance organisation, the aircraft was flown to Blackbushe for further technical investigation. After landing on Runway 26 the aircraft left the runway, struck a series of obstructions and was destroyed: there was no fire and the pilot was uninjured. The support bracket for the right main landing gear weight-on-wheels switch was found to have sustained a pre-impact failure which accounted for the indications reported by the pilot. Five recommendations have been made as a result of this investigation.
