At 1704LT, the airplane took off from Rotterdam Airport and climbed to the south according to departure routes. At 1709LT, the crew noticed heavy rainfall and thunderstorms on the weather radar and was cleared to change heading to avoid this area. Three minutes later, the airplane entered a zone of heavy altitude downdrafts and updrafts with severe turbulences, which resulted in loads on the airframe increasing to +6.8 G and -3,2 G. These excessive G loads compromised the structural integrity of the aircraft and especially the right wing from which a large portion separated. From an altitude of 3,000 feet, the airplane entered a dive and disintegrated while crashing on a highway crossing near Moerdijk. All 17 occupants were killed.
