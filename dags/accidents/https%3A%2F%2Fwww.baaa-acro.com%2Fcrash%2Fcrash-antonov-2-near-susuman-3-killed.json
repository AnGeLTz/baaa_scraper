It was carrying three crew members and three operators of the NPN Group. While cruising in a valley at an altitude of 800 meters, the airplane struck power cables (it cut three cables), went out of control and crashed in flames 375 meters further. All three crew members were seriously injured and all three passengers were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew failed to follow the minimum prescribed altitude during the mission and failed to see and avoid the cables that were located about 50 meters above the ground. A poor flight planning and the fact that the mission was not well organized by the geophysical company were considered as contributing factors. "}
