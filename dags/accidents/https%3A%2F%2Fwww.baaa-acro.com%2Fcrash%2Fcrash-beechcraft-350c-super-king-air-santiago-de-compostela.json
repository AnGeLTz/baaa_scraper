Once cleared to land, the aircraft encountered a fog patch and from this moment it began a high rate descent (2,000 to 3,000 feet per minute). A minute after entering an unexpected and unforeseen fog patch, at 00:13:02 of June 7, the aircraft struck some trees, in level flight and with an airspeed of 148 knots. The wings and engines detached from the fuselage, and they dragged along a scrubland area until they came to a stop. The crew suffered minor injuries and the aircraft was completely destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The probable cause was the decision to start a visual approach without having the runway in sight and the continuance of the visual approach in spite of the loss of external visual references, as they unexpectedly entered a fog patch.
