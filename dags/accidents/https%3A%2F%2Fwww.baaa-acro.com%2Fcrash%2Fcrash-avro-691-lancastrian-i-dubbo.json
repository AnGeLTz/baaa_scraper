After several landings and takeoffs completed, the crew consisting of one instructor and seven pilots under supervision decided to perform a flapless landing. After touchdown, the pilot in command realized that his speed was too high and that he would be unable to stop within the remaining distance. He took the decision to make a sharp turn to the right to vacate the runway when the left main gear collapsed. The left wing contacted the ground and was sheared off at the root, causing the fuel to flow on the ground and to ignite while contacting sparks generated by the friction of the metal with the runway surface. The aircraft veered off runway and came to rest in flames. All eight occupants were quickly evacuated while the aircraft was destroyed by fire.
