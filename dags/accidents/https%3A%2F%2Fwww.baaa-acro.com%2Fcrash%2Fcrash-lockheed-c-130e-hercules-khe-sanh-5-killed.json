The aircraft was attempting to deliver a load of sandbags by flying low and slow over the runway and pushing them out of the back. The sandbags were needed as part of a major reconstruction programme at the base and had to airdropped as the runway was being rebuilt. The weather was poor at the time with a low cloud base and the accident was thought to have been due to pilot error rather than enemy action. \r\nCrew:\r\nCpt Erie Lawrence Bjorke,\r\n1st Lt James Randall Hottenroth,\r\nT/Sgt Edward Mosley,\r\nA2C John Herbert Snyder,\r\nSgt Charles Lynn Baney.\r\nSource: Chris Hobson", "probable_cause": "Pilot error.
