His route was to have been Wheaton Aston - Shawbury - Condover - Wheaton Aston, this triangular route was a distance of just over 50 miles. At some point, the pilot became disorientated, whether he missed one of his waypoints or saw one of the other airfields in the area is unknown, and ended up flying North East. As the sun was coming into view the aircraft was seen circling over Buxton, shortly afterwards the aircraft flew west into low cloud and struck a dry stone wall which runs the length of Burbage Edge. The stone wall destroyed the forward end of the aircraft killing the lone occupant, the aircraft broke up as it traveled across the moor land for another 30 to 40 yards.\r\nCrew (11th AFU):\r\nSgt John Henry Langley Wilson.\r\nSource: \r\nhttp://www.peakdistrictaircrashes.co.uk/pages/peakdistrict/peakdistricteb717.htm", "probable_cause": "The Investigating Officer from No.21 Group concluded that the pilot had set the wrong course on his final leg from Condover back to Wheaton Aston."}
