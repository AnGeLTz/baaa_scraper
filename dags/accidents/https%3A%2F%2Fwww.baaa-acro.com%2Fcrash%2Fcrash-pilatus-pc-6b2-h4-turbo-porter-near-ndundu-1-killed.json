The aircraft was to pick up a medical patient from Taive II. After landing and unloading cargo at Taive II, the aircraft departed from Taive II for NduNdu, Papua, at 1106 with an estimated time of arrival of 1113. The flight was to be operated in accordance with the visual flight rules (VFR), remaining clear of cloud and navigating visually. When the aircraft had not arrived by 1213, the Wamena authorities decided to search for the aircraft. Three operators assisted the search; Association of Mission Aviation (AMA), Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF), and Yajasi. They all reported hearing PK-RCZ\u2019s emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal, but were unable to reach the crash site due to the weather conditions. At 2020 (0520 local time on Sunday 10 August), the aircraft wreckage was found at an elevation of 6,400 feet at the coordinates 03\u00b0 26\u2019 08\u201d S, 138\u00b0 21\u2019 58\u201d E, in the area of NduNdu Pass, on the aircraft\u2019s planned track.
