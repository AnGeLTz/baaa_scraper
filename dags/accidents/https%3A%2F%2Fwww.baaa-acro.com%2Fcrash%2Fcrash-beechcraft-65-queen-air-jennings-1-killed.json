No radios were onboard the aircraft so no distress calls were made. Because of the wind this would have been a downwind landing. The aircraft then aborted the approach due to an aircraft landing from the opposite direction and appeared to start a left turn onto abase leg when it stalled, pitched nose down and impacted the ground with its landing gear and flaps extended. Wreckage examination revealed that all 3 blades of the right prop were bent smoothly and symmetrically rearward. However, no preimpact failure or malfunction of the right engine was found. There were no entries in the aircraft's logbook from 7/1/78 until 4/3/84 when the aircraft was inspected for the ferry flight. The pilot was not multi-engine rated and had not flown this type aircraft in about 10 years. The pilot's commercial certificate was revoked on 11/21/81. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
