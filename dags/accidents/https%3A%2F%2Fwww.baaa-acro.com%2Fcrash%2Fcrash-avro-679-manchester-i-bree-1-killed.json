Following an uneventful mission, the aircraft returned to its base in England. While overflying Belgium by night, the bomber was shot down by the German Flak. The captain ordered his crew to abandon the aircraft and to bail out. Sole on board, the pilot attempted to make an emergency landing in Bree, some 21 km northwest of Gent. But the aircraft went out of control and crashed in a drainage ditch and was destroyed. While the captain was killed, all six others occupants were unhurt and taken POW.\r\nCrew (50th Squadron):\r\nF/O Leslie Thomas Manser, pilot, \u2020\r\nSgt Leslie H.
