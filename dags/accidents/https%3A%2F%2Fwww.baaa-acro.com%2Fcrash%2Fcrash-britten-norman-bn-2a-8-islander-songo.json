While cruising at an altitude of 4,700 feet, the right engine caught fire after being hit by a surface-to-air missile. The pilot initiated a rapid descent and elected to divert to Songo Airport for an emergency landing when the right engine detached shortly later. Despite a critical situation, the pilot was able to land at Songo Airport and to stop the airplane on the runway. All five occupants escaped safely while the aircraft was destroyed by fire. \r\nSource and photos: \r\nhttp://voandoemmozambique.blogspot.com/2012/05/772-cte-joaquim-maria-craveiro.html", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft was struck by a surface-to-air missile shot by Frelimo rebels.
