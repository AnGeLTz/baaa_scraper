At 0222LT, while climbing to 21,000 feet, the crew encountered technical problems with the hydraulic systems and was cleared to return. The captain made a 180 turn and followed a circuit and a holding pattern to burn fuel until he started the final approach to runway 06. After touchdown, the crew started the braking procedure but the airplane was apparently unable to stop within the remaining distance. Approaching the end of the runway, the aircraft veered to the right, lost its right main gear and came to rest in a sandy area with the right engine torn off and the right wing severely damaged. All 128 occupants evacuated, among them six were injured. One week later, on November 16, a 86 year old woman died from her injuries (fractured skull).", "probable_cause": null}
