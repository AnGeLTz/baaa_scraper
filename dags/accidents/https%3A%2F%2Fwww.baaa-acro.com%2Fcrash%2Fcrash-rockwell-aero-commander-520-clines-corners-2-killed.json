An en route stop was made at Tucumcari, NM, where the aircraft was refueled and 14 qts of oil was added to the left engine. The line boy who serviced the aircraft saw no visible oil leaks or spillage around the engine. While on the next leg of the flight, the aircraft crashed near interstate highway 40. Two witnesses that saw the crash stated rain was falling, the wind was blowing very strong and there were low ceilings. Reportedly, a squall line was moving thru the area and there was moderate to severe turbulence. An exam of the wreckage revealed the aircraft had crashed in a steep nose down attitude, with 20\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 left bank and at high speed. No preimpact, mechanical failures were found and both engines had evidence that they were operating during impact. The weather briefer said the pilot indicated he would fly around the area of precipitation and remain VFR. Radar info showed the pilot had been following the interstate highway and varying his alt between 7,900 and 6,300 feet msl. Both occupants were killed.
