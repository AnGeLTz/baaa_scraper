It was en route from Daly Waters to Alice Springs with two passengers on board, two crew members and a crocodile that was destined for the Melbourne Zoo. The crew reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing in a uninhabited area located near Woodgreen Station, Northern Australia. Upon landing, the aircraft slid for several yards and hit trees before coming to rest. The engineer walked some 30 miles to the overland telegraph line to find help. All passengers were eventually rescued and they survived as they ate the crocodile.", "probable_cause": "Engine failure in flight."}
