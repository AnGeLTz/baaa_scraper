He then restarted the left engine but neither developed enough power to sustain flight. He executed a forced landing on a highway and struck a vehicle and a fire erupted. Examination of the left engine revealed a cross threaded fuel nozzle fitting and soot patterns aft of it. No cause for the right engine failure was found. No evidence of an annual inspection was found.", "probable_cause": "The improper maintenance work by an unknown person who cross threaded a fuel nozzle injector fitting which allowed fuel to leak on the exhaust system initiating a fire. No reason for the right engine not to develop full power was found."}
