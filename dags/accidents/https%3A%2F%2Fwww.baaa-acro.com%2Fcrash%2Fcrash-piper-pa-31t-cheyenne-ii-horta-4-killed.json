At 1751LT, the mission was over and the pilot was cleared to descend to Horta Airport. On final approach to runway 29, after being cleared to land, the aircraft entered a right turn then lost height and crashed 600 meters to the right of the runway 29 extended centerline.

Nevertheless, the following hypothesis were not ruled out: asphyxia to carbon monoxide, convulsion or a heart attack. "}
