While flying at low height, the airplane struck tree tops then stalled and crashed in a dense wooded area located about 30 km east of the Tuy H\u00f2a Airfield. As the airplane crashed in an enemy zone, it was not possible to intervene immediately and the first rescuers reached the crash site two weeks later only. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 85 occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, the ceiling was down to 50 feet from the ground and the crew was apparently not aware of his too low altitude.\r\nCrew:\r\nMaj Robert Milvoy Horsky, \r\nCpt George Parker McKnight,\r\nS/Sgt Mercedes Perez Salinas,\r\nS/Sgt Donald David Stewart.", "probable_cause": null}
