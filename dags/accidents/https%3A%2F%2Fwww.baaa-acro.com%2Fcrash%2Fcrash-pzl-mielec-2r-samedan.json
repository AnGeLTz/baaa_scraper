While climbing to a height of 125 metres, the engine failed. The pilot initiated a 180\u00b0 turn for an immediate landing on runway 21 when, at a speed of 140 km/h, the aircraft struck tree tops and crashed inverted to the right side of the runway. The wreckage was found 350 metres past the runway threshold and 20 metres to the right. All three occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by an engine failure in the climbing phase, in which the altitude of the aircraft was not sufficient for a 180\u00b0 turn.\r\nThe following possibly contributed to the engine failure:\r\n- Carburettor icing,\r\n- Incorrect mixture regulation setting."}
