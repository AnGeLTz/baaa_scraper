The airplane was destroyed upon impact and the pilot, Bruce John Oliver, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "According to the board of investigations, the accident was the consequence of the following factors:\n- The pilot was aware of the presence of the wires and their position was clearly indicated by the associated firebreak,\n- The poles suspending the wires were situated at different levels, causing the lines to slope,\n- The higher pole was obscured from the pilot's view, thus he did not anticipate the slope of the wires,\n- The pilot judged his crossing of the wires by reference to the lower pole and as a result collided with the upward-sloping wires."}
