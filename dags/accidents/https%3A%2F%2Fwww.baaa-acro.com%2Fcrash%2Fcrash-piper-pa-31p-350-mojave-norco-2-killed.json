He was given a low altitude alert, but continued the approach. He announced a missed approach, and indicated problems climbing to altitude. He then declared an unspecified emergency, and requested vectors to a larger airport, in spite of worsening weather conditions. He reached an altitude of 2,100 feet, but commenced another ILS approach despite previous difficulties. Radar data indicates excessive maneuvering to intercept the inbound course, with wide variations in ground speed and altitude. Following a steep climb at a low groundspeed, the aircraft disappeared below radar coverage. Witnesses indicated irregular engine sounds as the aircraft made a tight level turn at low altitude prior to impacting trees in a near level attitude. On-scene evidence shows power was being produced from both engines upon impact. Post-impact fire consumed the wreckage. Both occupants were killed.
