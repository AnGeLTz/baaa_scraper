As the crew was unable to locate the runway, the captain decided to abandon the approach and initiated a go-around manoeuver. Few minutes later, while completing a second attempt to land, the aircraft descended below the glide when it struck power cables and crashed 4 km short of runway 06, bursting into flames. All 10 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the crew descended below the MDA to establish a visual contact with the ground while approaching the airport in a 500 meters visibility due to fog.
