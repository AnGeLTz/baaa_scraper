The aircraft departed Gao at 1015LT bound for the north. It overflew Tabankort then the crew planned to make a fuel stop at El Quit where a quantity of 220 liters of fuel was hidden in the sand. Some 30 km before the destination, the engine failed. The crew attempted an emergency landing when, on touchdown, the left main gear collapsed and ripped the fuselage on the left side, shearing off the left wing as well. All three crew were unhurt but the aircraft was abandoned on site. All three occupants were rescued and evacuated six days later, on 28APR1930, by members of the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transafricaine, and arrived in France on 05MAY1930. The airplane was eventually recovered 80 years later and repatriated to Paris where it was repaired and displayed at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Air et de l'Espace at Paris-Le Bourget Airport. \r\nCrew:\r\nMarcel Goulette, pilot,\r\nRen\u00e9 Marchesseau, pilot,\r\nJean-Michel Bourgeois, mechanic.", "probable_cause": "Engine failure for unknown reasons."}
