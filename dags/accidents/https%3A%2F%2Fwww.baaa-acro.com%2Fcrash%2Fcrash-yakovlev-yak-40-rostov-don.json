", "probable_cause": "Following a wrong manipulation, the flight engineer activated the thrust reversers on engine n\u00b01 and n\u00b03 but not on the engine n\u00b02 that was providing full power. Such configuration reduced the braking action and the crew was unable to stop the aircraft within the landing distance available. "}
