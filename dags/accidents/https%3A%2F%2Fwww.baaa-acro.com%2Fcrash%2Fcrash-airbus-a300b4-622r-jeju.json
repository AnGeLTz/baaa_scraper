On final approach, flaps were deployed at 15\u00b0/20\u00b0 as the captain was suspecting windshear and microburst conditions. Twice, the copilot informed the captain about the approach speed of 147 knots which was acknowledged. The captain continued the approach but too high on the glide, the aircraft landed too far down the runway, about 1,773 metres past its threshold. On a wet runway surface, the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance (1,227 metres remaining), overran at a speed of 104 knots and eventually collided with a concrete wall and military barracks, bursting into flames. All 160 occupants were quickly evacuated, among them seven were slightly injured. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who completed the approach at an excessive speed and too high on the glide. Investigations did not confirm any windshear or microburst conditions. The crew failed to initiate a go-around procedure. "}
