The aircraft came in too fast, bounced, touched down again after 600 meters and ended up in the trench of an anti-aircraft artillery position. It came to rest on its nose.

All five crew members escaped unhurt.\n", "probable_cause": "Wrong decision on part of the captain who decided to land in a disused airfield in below minima weather conditions. "}
