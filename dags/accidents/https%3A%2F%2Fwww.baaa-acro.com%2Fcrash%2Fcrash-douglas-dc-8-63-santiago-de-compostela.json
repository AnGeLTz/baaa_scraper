Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran, lost its undercarriage and came to rest in flames in a wooded area, broken in two. All 223 occupants were evacuated, 52 of them were injured, some seriously. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who continued the approach above the glide and landed too far down the runway, reducing the braking distance available. The braking action was also limited because the runway surface was wet, which was considered as a contributing factor. "}
