While reaching the altitude of 6,000 feet, the captain sighted eight Japanese fighters. He decided to return and changed his route near Macao when he was attacked by five Nakajima fighters. The captain decided to make a steep descent to escape the attack and attempted an emergency landing on a river bank. Unfortunately, the aircraft crashed and came to rest upside down. Fourteen occupants were killed while four others survived, among them two crew members. It seems most of the passengers were killed by bullets and not by the accident itself. \r\nCrew:\r\nHugh Woods, captain,\r\nLieu Chung-chuan, copilot,\r\nJoe Loh, radio operator,\r\nWu Ching-hua, steward.", "probable_cause": "Shot down by Japanese fighters.
