They passed the US coast near Atlantic City and the flight continued over sea to Miami. The Florida coast was not sighted however. After heading west, the crew observed the Berry Group Islands (Bahamas). Since they didn't have enough fuel to reach Nassau, a forced belly landing was carried out on a beach. The surf later damaged the aircraft beyond repair. Although it cannot be proven, it was thought that the crew were asleep during part of the flight and that the autopilot processed and turned the plane westward.\r\nSource: ASN", "probable_cause": null}
