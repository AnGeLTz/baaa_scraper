Two witnesses to the accident who saw the accident airplane lift off from the runway described the flight path as erratic in nature with random movement in all three axis, pitch, roll and yaw. The witnesses did not see the actual impact. Evidence shows that the upper half of the main entry clamshell door was not closed at impact. Radio transmissions from the accident airplane while in flight show a elevated voice level indicative of stress as the pic attempted to maintain control the airplane during pitch and roll excursions. The radio transmissions were unintelligible. The tower had cleared the aircraft to land on any runway. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
