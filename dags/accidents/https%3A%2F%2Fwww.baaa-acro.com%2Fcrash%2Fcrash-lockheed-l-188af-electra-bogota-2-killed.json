With a high angle of attack, the airplane stalled and banked right before crashing in flames onto the tarmac where it collided with a parked Aerocosta Colombia DC-6F registered HK-756. Both aircraft were destroyed by fire and while the DC-6 was empty, two of the four crew members on board the Electra were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong manoeuvre on part of the pilot-in-command after takeoff caused the aircraft to adopt a nose up attitude and stall. Poor flight preparation and lack of crew coordination were considered as contributing factors. The assumption that an engine lost power or failed after rotation was not ruled out, which may have influenced the loss of control. "}
