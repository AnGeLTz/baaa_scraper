Two passengers unfastened their seatbelt to close the door. This movement in the cabin caused the center of gravity to move past the rear limit by 37%. The aircraft reached a super critical angle of attack and at a speed of 60-65 km/h, it stalled and crashed in a near flat attitude near the runway (rate of descent estimated between six and eight meters per second). Two passengers were killed while 10 other occupants were injured. The copilot died from his injuries two days later.
