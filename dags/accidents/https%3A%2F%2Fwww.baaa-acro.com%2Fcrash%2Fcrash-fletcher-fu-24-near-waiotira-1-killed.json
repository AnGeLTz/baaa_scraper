A little further on, and at a lower level, the port wingtip struck the ground causing the plane to make a heavy impact in a totally inverted position. The airplane then slid about 100 feet (30 metres ) before coming to rest. A small fire stated but quickly burned itself out. The pilot was killed. ", "probable_cause": "he pilot attempted to fly across a ridge but misjudged the climb capability of his aircraft, and struck a fenceline marking the top. When the aircraft struck the fenceline it was in a partially stalled condition. Control of the aircraft was lost as the result of the collision with the fenceline. Inexperience of the pilot was a large factor in the occurrence of the accident."}
