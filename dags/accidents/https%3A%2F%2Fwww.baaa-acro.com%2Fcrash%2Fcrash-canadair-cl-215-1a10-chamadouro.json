Following a scooping mission in the Agu\u00edeira Reservoir off Chamadouro, the crew increased engine power and started a takeoff procedure when control was lost. The takeoff was abandoned but the aircraft collided with the shore and came to rest. Both pilots escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of directional control of the aircraft during takeoff and the track during deceleration (after the abortion decision) in order to avoid collision with the bank, was considered as the primary cause of the accident. The following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Poor Crew Resource Management,\r\n- Lack of crew communication,\r\n- The orographic conditions were substantially different from those where the crew received their training and developed their operational activities."}
