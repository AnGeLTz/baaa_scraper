On final approach to Buenos Aires-Ezeiza-Ministro Pistarini Airport runway 11, at a speed of 151 knots, the crew quickly extended flaps to 14\u00b0, 25\u00b0, 40\u00b0 and finally 50\u00b0, causing the aircraft to nose down and enter a rapid descent until it struck the ground 750 metres short of runway threshold. Upon impact, the aircraft broke in three and caught fire. Both pilots were killed while six other occupants were injured.", "probable_cause": "The following findings were reported:\r\n- Erroneous setting of the air brakes at the same time as the flaps were fully extended during the short final approach, \r\n- Erroneous planning during the descent and approach,\r\n- Failure to use the experience of a similar previous event,\r\n- Insufficient attention to the critical situation in the aircraft operating documentation,\r\n- Failure to conduct a briefing prior to the approach and descent,\r\n- Non-use of the LCP during the entire approach maneuver,\r\n- Insufficient training in CRM."}
