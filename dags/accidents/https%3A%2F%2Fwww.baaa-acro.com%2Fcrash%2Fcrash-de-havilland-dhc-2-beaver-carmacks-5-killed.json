While approaching Carmacks in good weather conditions, the pilot was making a circuit to land when the airplane rolled over and spun into the ground. It crashed in a bank just below the Mayo Road at a location approximately in between the Territorial Garage and the Carmacks bridge. The burned wreckage was found by the Yukon River and all five occupants have been killed. At the time of the accident, weather conditions were considered as good. \r\nCrew:\r\nSgt K. M.

Nevertheless, it was established that no mechanical failure occurred on the airplane prior to the accident. The pilot was skilled and it is believed that the loss of control may have been caused by local downdrafts or by a stall due to an insufficient speed. "}
