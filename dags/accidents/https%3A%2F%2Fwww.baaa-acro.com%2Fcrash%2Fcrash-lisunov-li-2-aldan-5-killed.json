While cruising in clouds, the left engine failed. The captain decided to divert to Aldan for an emergency landing. On approach, the crew was unable to lower the gear so the captain decided to make a go-around. Due to the presence of mountains all around the airport, the captain decided to make a sharp turn to the left. From a height of 15-20 meters, the airplane banked left then stalled and crashed in a snow covered field located near the airport. The aircraft was destroyed and all five occupants were killed.
