A physical examination and the pilot's statement indicate that the pilot was operating under an extreme amount of stress which may have resulted in chronic fatigue at the time of the accident. According to the pilot, he was accustomed to a very heavy flight schedule. The chief pilot attempted to assign an additional pilot but company budget constraints prevented such an assignment.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with terrain/water\r\nPhase of operation: descent - uncontrolled\r\nFindings\r\n1.
