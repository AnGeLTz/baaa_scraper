In such situation, the captain decided to abort the takeoff procedure and applied brakes. It appears the aircraft failed to decelerate properly so the crew activated the emergency brakes that were effectives on the right main gear only. As the end of the runway was approaching, the captain retracted the undercarriage so the airplane sank on its belly and slid before coming to rest into the Guanabara Bay. The aircraft sank about 10 minutes later and was lost. Eight passengers were killed while 57 other occupants were injured, some of them seriously.  ", "probable_cause": null}
