Four minutes later, the right turn failed as well. The airplane lost height and crashed in an open field located 9 km from Hamilton Airport. All six occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of both engines after the crew failed to realize that the fuel selector was positioned on the wrong fuel tank. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- After the second engine failure, the crew failed to plan effectively for a forced landing, and ultimately failed to maintain controlled flight, \r\n- Probable factors contributing to these failures include: workload, time pressure, unfamiliarity with the situation in which they found themselves and inexperience on type.
