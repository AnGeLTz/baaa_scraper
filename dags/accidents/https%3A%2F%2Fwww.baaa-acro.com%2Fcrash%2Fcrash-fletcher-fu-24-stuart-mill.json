The pilot dumped the load and operated the fuel boost pump, however after a short burst of power the engine failed completely. The pilot was committed to a downwind landing and towards the end of the landing roll the aircraft ran into a gully and collided with tree stumps. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and the pilot was slightly injured. ", "probable_cause": "The engine had failed from fuel exhaustion. The pilot was not aware of the amount of fuel added to the tanks at the previous refuelling and he had subsequently relied on the fuel gauge readings to assess the remaining endurance."}
