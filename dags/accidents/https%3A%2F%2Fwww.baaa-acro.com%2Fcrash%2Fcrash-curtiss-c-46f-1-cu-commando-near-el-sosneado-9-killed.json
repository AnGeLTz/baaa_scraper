An intermediate stop was scheduled at Santiago de Chile. The crew continued the flight under VFR at 3,000 meters in good weather conditions but while approaching the region of San Luis, weather deteriorated with turbulences and poor conditions. While cruising at an altitude of 4,500 meters, the airplane disintegrated in the air and eventually crashed on the slope of a mountain located near El Sosneado. SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. The wreckage was spotted on 21 November 1961 in an isolated area. \r\nCrew:\r\nPedro Lafuente, pilot,\r\nFerm\u00edn G\u00f3mez, copilot,\r\nDomingo Vacarelli, mechanic, \r\nOscar Carballo, navigator.\r\nPaasengers:\r\nSergio Etcheverry, \r\nCarlos Luj\u00e1n, \r\nPedro Puccineri, \r\nOmar Silva,\r\nRa\u00fal D\u00edaz.", "probable_cause": "The aircraft flew into extremely violent turbulence, was subjected to stresses greater than those for which it was designed, and in-flight structural failure resulted. Contributing causes were: \r\n- Insufficient flight preparation,\r\n- Failure of the pilote to familiarize himself with the prevailing weather conditions,\r\n- The horses were improperly secured. "}
