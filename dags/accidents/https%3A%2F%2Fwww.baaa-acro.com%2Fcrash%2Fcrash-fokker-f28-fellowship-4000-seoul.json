The captain decided to abandon the takeoff and initiated an emergency braking procedure. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, lost its undercarriage, cartwheeled and came to rest, bursting into flames. All 48 occupants were evacuated, among them 21 were injured. The aircraft was totally destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the loss of power on the left engine was the consequence of ice that detached from the left upper wing and went into the engine. This caused the high pressure compressor to stall, followed by vibrations and a loss of directional control. \r\nThe following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Poor flight preparation on part of the flying crew, \r\n- The aircraft has not been properly deiced prior to takeoff.
