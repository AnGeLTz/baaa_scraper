The captain decided to abandon the landing, attempted a go around and increased engine power. After takeoff, while climbing to a height of approximately 50 feet, the airplane turned to the left when it stalled and crashed onto a hangar. The aircraft was destroyed and both crew members were killed. There were no injuries on the ground. ", "probable_cause": "The reason why the aircraft bounced on landing could not be determined with certainty. However, it was understood that the left engine partially lost power or failed during initial climb for unknown reason. This caused the aircraft to stall and to crash as the failure occurred at a critical stage of flight (low speed and low altitude). "}
