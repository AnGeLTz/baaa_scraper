The on board delegation was flying to Morocco to take part to a conference. Rumors of a bomb on board caused the crew to divert to Port of Spain. A screwdriver was found in the hatch containing the IFF device but no trace of a bomb. While flying over Suriname, the aircraft exploded in mid-air, disintegrated and crashed in an isolated area located 30 miles northeast of Paramaribo. All 35 occupants were killed, among them Eric Mowbray Night, author and creator of the fictional collie 'Lassie'. He was Major by the US Army Special Services as well.
