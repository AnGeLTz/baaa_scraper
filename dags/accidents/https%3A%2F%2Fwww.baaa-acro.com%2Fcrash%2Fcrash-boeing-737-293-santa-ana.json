While Flight 336 approached, the controller cleared Air California Flight 931 for a runway 19R takeoff. When recognizing the hazard, the controller ordered Flight 336 to abort the landing and go-around and Flight 931 to abort the takeoff. Flight 931 rejected its takeoff, but Flight 336 landed with the gear retracted. The 737 left the runway surface at 900 feet past the threshold and skidded another 1,170 feet before coming to rest 115 feet to the right of the centreline. The aircraft lost its both engines and came to rest, broken in two. All 110 occupants were evacuated, four of them were injured. ", "probable_cause": "The captain\u2019s failure to immediately initiate a go-around when instructed to do so by the tower\u2019s air traffic controller and his subsequent failure to correctly execute the specified go-around procedure which resulted in the retraction of the landing gear after the aircraft touched down on the runway."}
