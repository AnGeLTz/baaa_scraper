As the fuselage was damaged, it was decided to abandon the aircraft on the ice and the crew later returned to Norway with another Dornier Do J Wal registered N-25. \r\nCrew:\r\nLeif Ragnar Dietrichson, pilot, \r\nLincoln Ellsworth, navigator, \r\nOskar Omdal, mechanic.", "probable_cause": "Engine problem.
