The Fairchild veered left upon rotation and cartwheeled off the runway, coming to rest 557 feet left of the runway and 6000 feet from the takeoff end. It appeared that the right inboard and outboard flaps were fully extended; the left inboard flap was extended 17 degrees and the left outboard flap was fully retracted.", "probable_cause": "An asymmetrical flap condition during takeoff caused by foreign object jamming of the flap gear box and malfunction of the rotary flap actuator assembly. Inadequate maintenance and inspection. Inadequate function of the asymmetrical flap warning indicator."}
