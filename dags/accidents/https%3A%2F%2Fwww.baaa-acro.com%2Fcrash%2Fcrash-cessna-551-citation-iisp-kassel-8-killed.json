The visibility was reduced with local patches of fog. On approach to runway 22, the pilot-in-command failed to realize his altitude was insufficient when the aircraft struck trees and crashed in a wooded area located 4,500 meters short of runway threshold and 1,100 meters from the extended centerline. The aircraft was destroyed and all eight occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew failed to follow the prescribed procedures and continued the approach below the glide in limited visibility. The pilot capacities were probably diminished by the presence of alcohol in his blood, which was considered as a contributing factor. The crew also failed to initiate a go-around procedure. "}
