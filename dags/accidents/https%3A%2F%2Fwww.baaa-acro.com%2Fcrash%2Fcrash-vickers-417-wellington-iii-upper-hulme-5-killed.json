It is reported that prior to this the aircraft had be the subject of a mock attack by two USAAF Spitfires, possibly operating from Atcham near Shrewsbury, one of the aircraft had come too close to Z1744 and cut the trailing ariel that the crew were using to communicate with their base.  With their primary means of communication cut the crew became disorientated and could not gain a fix on Lichfield, after flying in cloud for some time the aircraft was seen to pass very low over Upper Hulme before crashing about 1/3 of a mile to the north.
