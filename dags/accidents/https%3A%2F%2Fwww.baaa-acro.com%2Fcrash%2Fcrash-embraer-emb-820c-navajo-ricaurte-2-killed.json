After entering the Venezuelan Airspace without clearance, the crew was contacted twice by ATC but failed to answer. Authorities decided to send two fighters to establish a visual and radio contact with the crew but without success as, due to the low visibility caused by night and poor weather conditions, the crew of the Navajo was able to continue the flight without further problem. Nevertheless, three hours later, the twin engine aircraft was again localized passing over the State of Cojedes, and the decision was taken to shoot it down. Out of control, the Navajo crashed in a pasture located in the region of Ricaurte, and was totally destroyed by impact forces. Both pilots were killed and a load of narcotics was found. At the time of the accident, the aircraft was illegally registered YV1246 as a sticker has been affixed above the official Brazilian registration PT-RCN.", "probable_cause": "Shot down by the pilot of a Venezuelan Air Force fighter.
