The aircraft crew sent a brief message saying that they were making a forced landing but when the pilot applied full flap, the aircraft went out of control, entering a spin from which it did not recover and it crashed and was destroyed by fire.\r\nCrew (514th Squadron):\r\nF/Lt Donald Beaton, pilot,\r\nF/Sgt Alfred McMurrugh, flight engineer,\r\nF/O Ray Bertram Hilchey, navigator, \r\nF/Sgt John Goodworth Brittain, wireless operator and air gunner,\r\nP/O Robert MacPherson Toms, air gunner,\r\nP/O Orval Clare Evers, air gunner.\r\nPassengers:\r\nCpt Robert Worsley Wheeler, \r\nLt Patrick Archibald Tomlin Campbell, \r\nLt Eric Thomas Theodore Snowden, \r\nSgt Ronald Arthur Adams, \r\nCpl Emanuel L.

However, the application of full flap caused loss of control."}
