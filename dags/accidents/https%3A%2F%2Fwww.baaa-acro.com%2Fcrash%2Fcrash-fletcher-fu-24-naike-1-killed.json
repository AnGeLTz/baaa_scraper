On his last run the flow of superphosphate was seen to cease at the appropriate point, but a couple of seconds later the remainder of the load was jettisoned. Almost immediately the aircraft entered a left-hand turn, striking the tops of some sapling pine trees. The plane then lost height, passed through a fence, and after crossing a narrow gully collided with a steep slope. The Fletcher caught fire and the pilot lost his life. The flying weather was good with a light westerly wind which increased to 10-15 mph not long before the accident, and with a change to a northerly direction. The pilot of another aircraft some 5 miles away reported the onset of turbulence in his area from about midday. The pilot, Clement Alan O'Neil, 23, was killed in this aerial topdressing accident. \nSource: \nhttps://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=63150", "probable_cause": "The accident resulted from a collision with the ground which, for reasons undetermined, the pilot was unable to avoid."}
