Upon reaching the cruise portion of the flight, the pilot realized that an insufficient quantity of fuel remained in order to complete the planned flight, and he elected to divert to a closer airport. While on final approach to the diversionary airport, both engines lost power, and the pilot made a forced landing to a parking lot. When asked about the performance and handling of the airplane during the flight, the pilot stated, \"the airplane performed the way it was suppose to when it ran out of fuel.\"", "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate preflight planning, which resulted in fuel exhaustion during the landing approach."}
