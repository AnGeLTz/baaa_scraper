The controller provided a vector to the nearest airport, but shortly after that, the pilot stated that he would not be able to reach the airport. The pilot did not inform ARTCC of his specific problem, except to say that the aircraft was descending rapidly. Subsequently, the aircraft crashed in a wooded area about 1/2 mile from an open area. During the investigation, about 1 quart of fuel was found remaining in the left inboard (aux) fuel tank. All of the other tanks were ruptured from impact. No evidence of fuel spillage was found at the accident site. The left prop was found in the feathered position and the right prop was found partially feathered. No preimpact part failure or malfunction was found. Both engines were started and both operated satisfactorily, after fuel was supplied by temporary tanks. The pilot and two passengers were killed while a fourth occupant was seriously injured. \n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (total) - nonmechanical\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
