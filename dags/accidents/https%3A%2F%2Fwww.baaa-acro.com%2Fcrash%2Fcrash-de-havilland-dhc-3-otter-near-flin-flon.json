It was being flown at low altitude with reduced power settings because of suspected low fuel and headwinds. The engine lost power due to fuel starvation and the pilot attempted an emergency landing when the airplane struck trees and crash landed in dense bush near Precipice Lake, Manitoba, about 10 miles north of Flin Flon.
