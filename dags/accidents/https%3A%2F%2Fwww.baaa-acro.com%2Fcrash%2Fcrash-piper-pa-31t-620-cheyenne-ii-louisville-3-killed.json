As the aircraft was on a straight-in approach to runway 11 from the west, the pilot was advised of traffic ahead and told to slow his speed as much as possible. The pilot acknowledged. About 15 seconds later, the controller told the pilot (of N63XL) to make a 360\u00b0 turn to the left for spacing. Shortly  hereafter, witnesses observed the aircraft enter a steep bank (turn), then go into a steep spiraling, nose down, descent and crash. No preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure of the aircraft or engines was found. All three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the pilot to maintain adequate airspeed, while maneuvering for spacing in the traffic pattern, which resulted in an inadvertent stall at low altitude."}
