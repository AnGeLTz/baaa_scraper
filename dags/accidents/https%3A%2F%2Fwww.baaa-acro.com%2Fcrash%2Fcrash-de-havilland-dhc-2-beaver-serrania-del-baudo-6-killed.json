About 20 minutes after its departure from Jurad\u00f3, the airplane disappeared and the pilot did not send any distress call. As the airplane failed to arrive in Medell\u00edn, SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the six occupants was found. The wreckage was found 12 years later in an isolated and uninhabited area near Serran\u00eda del Baud\u00f3, about 100 km south from the route Jurad\u00f3 - Medell\u00edn. ", "probable_cause": null}
