Several witnesses stated that the left prop was windmilling. One stated the left prop had stopped. Two others said smoke was trailing from the aircraft. One witness stated that after the aircraft passed over his car, a fine mist of oil fell on his windshield. When the aircraft was recovered from the canal, the left prop was found in the feathered position while the right prop was near its low pitch stops. The left prop dome was found depleted of air pressure and no oil was found in the left engine case. Also, an oil film was found on the bottom of the left eng, left flap and left stabilizer. A further exam revealed that an oil interconnect line, Piper pn: 920024-811, had failed inside its fireproof covering. The hose was 8 years old, its recommended replacement interval was 5 years. It had been installed with a small bend radius. Also, the left engine had evidence of heat and wear due to lack of oil.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power(partial) - mech failure/malf\r\nPhase of operation: approach - VFR pattern - final approach\r\nFindings\r\n1.
