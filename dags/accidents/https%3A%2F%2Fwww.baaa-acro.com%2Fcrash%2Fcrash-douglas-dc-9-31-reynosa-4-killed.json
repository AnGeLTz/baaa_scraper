Following a wrong approach configuration, the aircraft was too high on the glide and approaching at an excessive speed. It landed too far down the wet runway 31 and was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, lost its undercarriage, struck several houses, went down an embankment and came to rest in a canal. All 90 occupants were rescued, among them one passenger was slightly injured. On the ground, four people were killed.
