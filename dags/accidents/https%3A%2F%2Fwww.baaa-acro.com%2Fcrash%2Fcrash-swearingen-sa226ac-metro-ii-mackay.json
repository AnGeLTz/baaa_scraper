During the subsequent landing on runway 14 at Mackay, the pilot attempted a single engine go-around when he suddenly had the (mistaken) impression that the landing gear was not down. He temporarily lost control of the aircraft but recovered to touch down on the flight strip to the left of the runway, some 500 m before the runway end. During the landing roll, the landing gear collapsed and the aircraft sustained substantial damage.", "probable_cause": "The report concludes that the engine power loss was caused by failure of the fuel pump high pressure relief valve. The pilot, believing that the landing gear was still retracted, initiated action to avoid a wheels-up landing. This action was initiated too late in the landing approach for a successful outcome."}
