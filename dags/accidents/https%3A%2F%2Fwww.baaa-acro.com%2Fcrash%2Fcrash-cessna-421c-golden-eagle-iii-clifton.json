The pilot and ground witnesses reported that shortly after lift-off, grayish/white smoke emanated from the left engine. The pilot was unable to feather the propeller, circled the airport about 2 times at a low altitude and landed between the runways. The post crash investigation disclosed the fire originated in the vicinity of the left engine turbocharger. The turbocharger oil line housing was found fractured. The housing was missing when the engines were shipped to Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM). The engine crates were opened before safety board investigators arrived at TCM to conduct the engine examination. The left engine exam disclosed external high temp distress and minor detonation signatures. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: fire\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
