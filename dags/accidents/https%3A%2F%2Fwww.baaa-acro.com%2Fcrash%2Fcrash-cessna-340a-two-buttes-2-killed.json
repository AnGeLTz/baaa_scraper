After departure, the aircraft was eventually cleared to FL210. At 1934 the pilot gave Denver ARTCC the following pirep: 'there's been some snow but I've been mostly in and out of the tops. Looks like I got clear skies above me most of the time...and it is moderately rough from time to time.' At 2045 Kansas City ARTCC advised the pilot he was at FL213. The pilot acknowledged he had drifted off altitude and was correcting and was heading 060\u00b0. At 2047 the controller advised the pilot he was at FL203. The pilot replied, 'we've had a gyro failure.' At 2049 radar contact was lost. The aircraft impacted an open field in a near vertical attitude. There was no evidence of airframe, engine, propeller, or flight control failure. Only one vacuum pump was recovered. The instrument panel and autopilot system were destroyed. Both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #2: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1. (c) reason for occurrence undetermined\r\n2.
