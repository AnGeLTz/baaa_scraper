A hard landing was made causing all three landing gear to collapse, folded the left wing aft just inboard of the engine and twisted the entire right wing about 30\u00b0 leading edge down. According to the pilot the aircraft was flown with 30\u00b0 of flaps on downwind and 47\u00b0 of flaps on base. He also reported that both airspeed indicators were stuck at 110 knots. According to photographs taken by an unidentified party, the flaps were in the up position in the pattern and during touchdown. Touchdown was made with the right main gear off the right side of the rwy. The aircraft wheel track is only 4 feet less than the width of the runway. The pilot did not have a type rating nor authorization in lieu of a type rating for the 15 minutes ferry flight. The pilot had 4,140 hours copilot time in the aircraft, during which he had never landed the aircraft.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: hard landing\r\nPhase of operation: landing - flare/touchdown\r\nFindings\r\n1.
