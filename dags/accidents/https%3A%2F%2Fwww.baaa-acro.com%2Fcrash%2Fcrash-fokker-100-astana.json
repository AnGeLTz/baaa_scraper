After the crew lowered the landing gear, he realized that the nose gear remained stuck in its wheel well. The captain abandoned the approach and initiated a go-around. During the holding circuit, the crew elected to lower the gear manually, without success. After a 50 minutes circuit, the crew decided to land without the nose gear. After touchdown on runway 22, the aircraft slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest. All 121 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
