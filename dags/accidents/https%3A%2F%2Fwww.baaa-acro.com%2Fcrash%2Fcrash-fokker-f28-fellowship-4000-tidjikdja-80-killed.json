Unable to establish a visual contact with the runway, the captain initiated a go-around procedure. Few minutes later, the crew attempted a second approach while the weather conditions did not improve. At a height of about 25 metres above the airfield, the aircraft nosed down and violently struck the runway surface. Upon impact, the undercarriage were torn off and out of control, the aircraft veered off runway and eventually collided with rocks, bursting into flames. Thirteen passengers were rescued while 80 other occupants were killed.
