While cruising at low level so that the passengers could take pictures, the airplane went out of control and crashed in a wooded area located near Potter Lake. The aircraft was destroyed and all three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, it is believed that a moose was spotted and a steep turn was initiated. During the turn, the pilot lost control of the aircraft that went in a steep nose down and inverted attitude. It was reported that the aircraft did not have a ventral fin installed and this was not a legal requirement. The fin makes a float equipped aircraft much more directionally stable. "}
