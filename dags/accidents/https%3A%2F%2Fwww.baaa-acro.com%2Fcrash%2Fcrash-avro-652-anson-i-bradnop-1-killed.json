He attempted to fly out of the cloud but the weather conditions were rapidly decreasing, the pilot found a gap in the cloud which he followed. On exiting the cloud he was confronted by rising ground and no room to manoeuvre and the aircraft struck the ground.  At the time of the accident the wireless operator was changing over to regional control from the local frequency for Cranage so the wireless was effectively useless for aiding navigation during this period. The aircraft hit the ground fairly level but it slid into a bank between two ditches which turned the aircraft over trapping the pilot in the then water filled ditch from which he did not escape.\r\nCrew (2nd SAN):\r\nSgt Arthur Maelor Owen, pilot, \u2020\r\nP/O William Pat Ferrie, navigator,\r\nF/S A.
