The crew was able to complete the braking procedure, vacated the runway and stopped the aircraft on the apron. All 92 occupants evacuated when the right wing partially failed. Few passengers were injured and the aircraft was later considered as damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that on short final, during the last segment, the copilot inadvertently extended the spoilers, causing the aircraft to enter a rapid descent until it impacted the runway surface with a positive acceleration that exceeded its certification. Presence of corrosion in the wing's root was reported as a contributing factor. Lack of crew coordination and poor planned approach also contributed to the mishap. "}
