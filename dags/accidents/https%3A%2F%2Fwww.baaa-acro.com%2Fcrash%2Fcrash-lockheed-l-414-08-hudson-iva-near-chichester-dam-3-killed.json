At 1437LT, the crew informed ground about his position and confirmed his ETA in Taree at 1501LT. About eight minutes later, the airplane hit trees and crashed in a dense wooded area located about 10 km north of the Chichester Dam. As the airplane failed to arrive, SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended two weeks later as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. Fifteen months later, on December 22, 1955, the pilot of a Butler Air Transport DH.114 Heron spotted the wreckage that was found about 20 feet below the summit. All three occupants have been killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nCpt Douglas Hereward Swain, pilot, \r\nF/O Alistair Sydney Cole-Milne, copilot. \r\nPassenger:\r\nCpt D. Burns.", "probable_cause": null}
