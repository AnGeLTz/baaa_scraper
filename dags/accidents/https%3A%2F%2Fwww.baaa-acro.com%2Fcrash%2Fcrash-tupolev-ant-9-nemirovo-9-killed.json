After two Japanese citizens get on board, the aircraft departed Velikiye Luki Airport at 1626LT on the final leg to Moscow-Bykovo Airport. The crew continued the flight at an altitude of 200 metres with regular radio communications with ATC. After passing Rzhev, the crew continued at night and the visibility was limited. At an altitude of 140 metres, the airplane collided with trees and crashed in a wooded area located in Nemirovo, some 27 km southwest of Volokolamsk. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all nine occupants were killed.

The total weight of the aircraft was high because the crew made full fuel at Velikiye Luki Airport, which was considered as aggravating circumstances as well as the absence of radio navigation en route.
