Prior to departure, during the flight preparation, the fleet captain confirmed that wind gusting to 72 km/h was ok for this kind of aircraft but told the captain and his crew to fly above the minimum altitude of 1,500 metres. For unknown reasons, the crew decided to continue the flight at an insufficient altitude of 200-250 metres. Gusty winds hit the front of the airplane that went out of control and crashed. "}
