Unable to locate the runway, the captain decided to abandon the approach and initiated a go-around manoeuvre. Few minutes later, a second attempt to land was also abandoned for similar reasons. During a third attempt, the crew descended below the glide to establish a visual contact with the ground when the airplane struck the ground. On impact, the undercarriage were torn off and the airplane slid in an open field before coming to rest few dozen meters short of runway. All eight occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The crew descended below the MDA in marginal weather conditions. "}
