While cruising east of Annecy in poor weather conditions, the twin engine aircraft hit the slope of Mt Tournette at the altitude of 1,950 meters and located near Th\u00f4nes. Upon impact, the aircraft caused an avalanche and all debris and the four crew bodies were recovered by snow. Thus, it was impossible for the rescue teams to locate the aircraft and all operations were suspended after few days. The wreckage and the dead bodies were eventually found during summer 1945. \r\nCrew:\r\n2nd Lt Kenneth V. Halverson, pilot,\r\n1st Lt Reeves K. Gauthier, copilot,\r\nS/Sgt Robert L.
