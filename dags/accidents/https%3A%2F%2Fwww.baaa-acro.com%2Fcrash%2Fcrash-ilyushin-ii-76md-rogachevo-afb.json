At a speed of 276 km/h, the aircraft touched down with a positive acceleration of 1.85 g about five meters to the right of the runway centerline. The aircraft bounced and landed a second time 160 meters further with a positive acceleration of 1,8 g. After landing, the aircraft went out of control, veered off runway to the right and collided with an APM-90 spotlight system installed on a ZiL-130 truck chassis. Upon impact, both right engines and the right main gear were torn off and the aircraft came to rest in snow. All 10 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
