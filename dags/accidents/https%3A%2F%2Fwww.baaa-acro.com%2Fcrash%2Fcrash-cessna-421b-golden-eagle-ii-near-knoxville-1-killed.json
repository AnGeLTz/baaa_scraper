The pilot climbed to FL210 where he started a descent and reported loss of manifold pressure in the left engine. The pilot indicated that weather was in his flight path and descent was required to avoid icing. 90 seconds later the pilot transmitted '...losing it...'. Radar data indicated aircraft had an inflight breakup at approximately 17,000 feet msl. There was no evidence of mechanical or structural malfunction prior to the breakup. The aircraft did not have a complete current annual and de-ice equipment was inoperative. The pilot had no actual instrument experience and was not certified for multi engine IFR flight. The pilot had a medical history of anxiety attacks and had been taking prescription medication, Xanax and Tofranil, for approximately three years prior to the accident. The blood contained 1.2 mcg/ml of imipramine (Tofranil) and 2.6 mcg/ml desipramine (metabolite of Tofranil). Xanax (alprazolam) was not reported in blood toxicology. These drugs have been known to produce side effects that include poor judgement. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
