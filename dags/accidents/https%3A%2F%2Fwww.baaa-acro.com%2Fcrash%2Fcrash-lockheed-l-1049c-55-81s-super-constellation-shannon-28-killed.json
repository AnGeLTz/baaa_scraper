It then started to descend until it crashed into the Shannon Estuary, about 8,170 feet from the departure end of runway 32. The crashed occurred approximately 35 seconds after liftoff. 28 occupants were killed while 28 others were rescued. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "- Failure of the captain to correlate and interpret his instrument indications properly during flap retraction, resulting in necessary action not being taken in sufficient time. This failure was partially accounted for by the effect on instrument indications of inadvertent and unexpected gear re-extension, \r\n- Loss of aircraft performance due to inadvertent landing gear re-extension,\r\n- The captain failed to maintain sufficient climb to give him an opportunity of meeting unexpected occurrences."}
