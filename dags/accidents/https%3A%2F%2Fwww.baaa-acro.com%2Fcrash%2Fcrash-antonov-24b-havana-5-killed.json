After it entered the approach path, the twin engine airplane collided with a Cubana Douglas DC-8-43. Registered CU-T1200, the DC-8 was approaching the same airport following an uneventful flight from Montreal with 13 passengers and a crew of 16 on board. Following the collision, the Antonov AN-24 went out of control, dove into the ground and crashed in flames. All five occupants were killed. The crew of the DC-8 was able to continue the approach and to land without further problems. All 29 occupants escaped uninjured but the aircraft was considered as damaged beyond repair after the engine n\u00b01 was torn off as well as a part of the left wing. ", "probable_cause": null}
