As he entered downwind security advised him of animals on the runway so he circled until they called back stating it was clear. Just as the airplane was touching down, two horses began to cross the runway. The pilot attempted to go-around; however, the airplane contacted both animals and the pilot elected to abort the go-around. The left main landing gear collapsed and the airplane slid to a stop. A post crash fire ignited and was extinguished shortly thereafter. The landing was being made during dark night conditions.", "probable_cause": "Ground personnel did not properly clear the runway of animals prior to reporting to the pilot that it was clear to land."}
