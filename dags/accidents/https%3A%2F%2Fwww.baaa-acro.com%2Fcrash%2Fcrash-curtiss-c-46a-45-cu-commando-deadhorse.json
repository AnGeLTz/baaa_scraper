During the last segment, the crew failed to realize his altitude was too low when the right main gear struck the ground short of runway threshold and was torn off. Power was increased and decision was taken to make a go-around but the right engine failed to respond properly. The airplane stalled and belly landed, slid for 460 meters and came to rest. While both pilots were uninjured, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command misjudged distance, speed and altitude on final approach. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Downdrafts,\r\n- Unfavorable wind conditions, \r\n- Overload failure, \r\n- Weather briefing by company dispatch,\r\n- Wind gusting to 23 knots."}
