However, the runway was closed for snow removal. When this was done, the crew was cleared for takeoff and just after liftoff from runway 10, the airplane encountered difficulties to gain height, stalled and crashed on a bank of the Iskar River located by the airport. The copilot was killed and two passengers drowned. All other occupants were rescued, some of them were injured.
