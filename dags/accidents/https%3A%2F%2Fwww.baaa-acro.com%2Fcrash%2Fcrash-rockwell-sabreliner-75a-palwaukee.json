After touchdown, the captain elected to use all available brake systems when the copilot stowed reversers. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran, went through a fence and a road and eventually crashed in a warehouse. Both pilots as well as three people on the ground were injured. The aircraft was destroyed as well as two cars. ", "probable_cause": "Overshoot on landing after the crew misjudged distance and speed. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Improper operation of powerplant and powerplant controls, \r\n- Spontaneous improper action on part of the copilot, \r\n- Poor crew coordination, \r\n- Selected wrong runway relative to existing wind,\r\n- Powerplant - thrust reverser,\r\n- Material failure, \r\n- Asymmetrical thrust reversal,\r\n- Right engine flex shafts failed."}
