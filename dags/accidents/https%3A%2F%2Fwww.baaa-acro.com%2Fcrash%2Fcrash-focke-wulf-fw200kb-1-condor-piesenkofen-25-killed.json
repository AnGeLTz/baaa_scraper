At 2150LT, the captain informed Munich he was overflying Straubing and initiated the descent. About ten minutes later, due to poor weather conditions (clouds, thunderstorm activity and turbulences), the captain radioed that he was continuing directly to Barcelona. Five minutes later, the aircraft went out of control, dove into the ground and crashed in a huge explosion in a field located 500 metres north of Piesenkofen.
