The captain decided to return for an emergency landing but failed to follow the published approach procedures and elected to land on the nearest runway. With a tailwind component, he completed a straight in approach but came too high so performed a sharp turn to the left when the left wing hit the ground. Out of control, the aircraft crashed and came to rest near the runway. The copilot and the flight engineer were killed while four other people were injured, three of them seriously. All other occupants escaped unhurt. ", "probable_cause": "The loss of power that occurred on the left engine shortly after takeoff was caused by a too low fuel octane ratio.
