The aircraft were typically approaching the end of their useful lives but only had to make it across the Atlantic. The aircraft had taken off from RAF Valley on Anglesey bound for Meeks Field in Keflavik. When the aircraft nearing the southern end of the Isle of Skye, the port outer engine caught fire. It would appear that the fire could not be brought under control, as when the aircraft crossed the coast, the port wing outboard of the number one engine broke away. As the wing fell, it struck the tail section, causing it to separate from the aircraft before the plane dived into a hilltop and exploded. All 14 occupants were killed.\nCrew:\n1st Lt William H.
