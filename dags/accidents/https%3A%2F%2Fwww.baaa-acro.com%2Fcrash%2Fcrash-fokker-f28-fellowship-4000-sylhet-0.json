Following an uneventful flight, the aircraft landed too far down a wet runway. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, it overran and came to rest in a drainage ditch. 30 passengers were slightly injured while all other occupants escaped unhurt. Both pilots were seriously injured as the cockpit was trapped against an earth wall.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew failed to refer to the PAPI's and following a wrong approach configuration, the aircraft landed too far down the runway, reducing the landing distance available. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- The ILS system was not properly calibrated, causing the aircraft to land about 900 feet past the runway threshold, \r\n- The aircraft was too high on approach, \r\n- The aircraft' speed at touchdown was 20 knots above the reference speed,\r\n- The braking action was considered as low because the runway surface was wet, \r\n- Aquaplaning,\r\n- The crew failed to initiate a go-around procedure.
