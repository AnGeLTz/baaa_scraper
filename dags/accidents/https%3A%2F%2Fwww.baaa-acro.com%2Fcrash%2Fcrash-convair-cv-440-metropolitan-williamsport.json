The aircraft was destroyed by fire. The failure of the right engine is attributed to the failure of the front row master rod and all the associated link rods. Damage to the rod ends precluded any determination of the cause of the master rod failure.", "probable_cause": "The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the crew to implement proper procedures for an engine failure on takeoff."}
