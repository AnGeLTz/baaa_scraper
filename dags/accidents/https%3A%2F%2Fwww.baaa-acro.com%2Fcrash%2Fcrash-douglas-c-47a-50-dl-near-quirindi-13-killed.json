", "probable_cause": "Investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the accident. However, the inquiry found that the probable cause of the crash was interference with the airplane's magnetic compass due to a nearby electrical storm and a defect in the navigational signals sent by the Government-maintained Kempsey low-frequency radio range station, an important navigational aid to flights in the area. Errors and deficiencies in the aeronautical charts used to navigate the mountainous area were also found. "}
