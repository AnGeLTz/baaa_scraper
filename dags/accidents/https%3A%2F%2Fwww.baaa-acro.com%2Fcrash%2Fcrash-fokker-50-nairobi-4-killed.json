Instrument Meteorological Conditions prevailed at the time and the airplane was on an instrument flight plan. The four crewmembers were fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed and consumed by post-crash fire. The destination of the flight was Aden Adee International Airport, Mogadishu, Somalia. The airplane was repositioned from its home base at Wilson Airport in Nairobi, the day before. The accident captain (CAPT) and another first officer conducted the repositioning flight. (see Aircraft Information). At JKIA, the airplane was loaded with cargo in preparation for the accident flight. The accident crew consisted of the Capt and FO in addition to a maintenance engineer and loadmaster. According to air traffic control (ATC), the flight plan was filed for duration of 2.5 hours at an altitude of 19,000 feet along with 5 hours of fuel aboard. Based on flight recorder data, the Capt was the pilot-flying and the FO was the pilot-monitoring. The accident flight was reconstructed using data from air traffic control and flight recorder information. According to FDR data, engine start occurred at at 01.50.20. At about 01.10.59 the flight made initial contact with JKIA air traffic control tower and after routine communication, including the confirmation of the number of person and fuel endurance, the flight was cleared for takeoff at 0112.30. At 01.11.58, both engines accelerated to a high power setting with engine no. 1 stabilizing at 78% torque, 100% propeller speed and engine 2 stabilizing at 80% torque, 99% propeller speed. About six seconds later, the Capt indicates \u201cpower is set\u201d. About 2 seconds afterwards the Capt indicated \u201cthe auto-feather is off, left\u201d and then 5 seconds later, the FO calls out \u201cseven eighty\u201d (?). About 16 seconds after initial engine acceleration was applied, the first of a series of three chimes audio alerts occurred, and continued at 1 second interval throughout the CVR recording. Immediately after the initial chimes, the Capt said \u201cyou see\u201d and \u201chow much is that?\u201d. The FO responded \u201cokay niner\u201d. The Capt then asked \u201cit has gotten to?\u201d The FO replied \u201cthirty four thirty ninety two\u201d and shortly afterward \u201cthe left one is thirty\u201d. About 24 seconds after initial engine acceleration, engine 1 torque climbs over a period of 2 seconds to a recorded value of 119.9%, the maximum value the recorder is capable of recording. Simultaneously Engine 1 propeller speed falls from 100% to 57%. Other engine shaft speeds remain at approximately their original high power values. Airspeed at the point this change occurs was less than 30 knots. During this period, the FO called out \u201cone twenty two now [pause] torque\u201d. The Capt responded \u201cit is rising eh? The FO then noted \u201ctorque one twenty six now\u201d. About 31 seconds after initial engine acceleration, the FO called out \u201cokay speed alive sixty\u201d. About a second later the Capt asked \u201cdo we reduce or\u201d? The FO responded \u201cwe can just cut\u201d. The Capt inquired \u201cdo we abort or continue?\u201d The FO responded, \u201cokay one one twelve and nine four point three\u201d and then \u201cokay one sixteen [pause] ninety four.\u201d The Capt acknowledged \u201cyeah okay\u201d About 47 seconds after initial engine acceleration, the Capt said twice \u201cdid I reduce it?\u201dand the FO responded sequentially \u201cyeah\u201d and \u201cokay\u201d] About 52 seconds after initial engine acceleration, the Capt asked \u201chow is it now?\u201d and the FO replied \u201cyeah one oh two [pause] ninety four\u201d. About 7 seconds later the FO called out \u201cokay, one sixteen ninety four\u201d. About 1 minute after initial engine acceleration, the Capt inquired \u201cIs it really going?\u201d The FO replied \u201cone oh one, ninety five\u201d. The Capt acknowledged and shortly afterward he queried \u201cis it going really, is the aircraft really moving\u201d. The FO responded \u201cokay, one oh one, ninety five\u201d. About 4 seconds later, the Capt indicated \u201cit is not giving power\u201d About 1 minute 9 seconds after the initial engine acceleration the FO called out \u201cokay speed has now reached about hundred\u201d. The Capt responded \u201coh yeah\u201d and immediately afterward the FO called out \u201cokay one eleven, ninety five\u201d. About 1 minute 18 seconds after the initial engine acceleration, the FO indicated \u201chundred now\u201d. The Capt acknowledged. About 1 minute 26 seconds after the initial engine acceleration, the FO called out \u201cV one V R rotate\u201d About 1 minute 33 seconds after the initial engine acceleration a transition of the airplane from ground to air mode is recorded and the pressure altitude begins to climb along with the Capt immediately afterward expressing two exclamations. Following the transition to air mode there were 51 seconds of flight recorder data before the recording ended. During this time and over a period of about 3 seconds, the FO calls out \u201cpositive rate of climb\u201d and the Capt responded \u201cgear up\u201d. About 3 second later, the Capt expressed \u201cit doesn\u2019t have power [pause] it\u2019s on one side.\u201d About 6 seconds afterward, the FO said \u201cwe can also turn back\u201d. About 3 seconds later the first of seven \u201cdon\u2019t sink\u201d (GPWS aural warning alerts) begins over a period of 23 seconds. After the second GPWS alert the Capt queried \u201cok, we\u2019re ok?\u201d After the third GPWS alert, the FO said \u201cwe can turn back\u201d and the Capt immediately responded \u201clet\u2019s just go\u201d. The FO replied \u201cokay\u201d. After the fifth GPWS alert, the Capt indicated \u201cand this one is showing one fourteen\u201d and then queried? \u201cwe can turn back?\u201d. About 2 seconds later, the FO called out \u201cokay speed is one hundred\u201d and the Capt responded \u201cbut this one has nothing\u201d About 1 second later and about the time of the sixth GPW alert, JKIA control tower radioed \u201cfive yankee charlie echo tango contact radar one two three decimal three. Good morning.\u201d After the seventh GPWS alert the recording ended about 13 seconds later. During this time, the controller called the aircraft again. The Capt expressed \u201ctell him [pause] tell him we have no power\u201d. The last CVR data indicates the FO radioed, \u201cah tower charlie echo\u201d and the transmission abruptly ended along with simultaneous sounds of distress. According to FDR data, about 15 seconds after the airplane transitioned from ground to air mode the recorded altitude peaked about 5060 feet and accompanied by a maximum airspeed of 100 knots. Along with a variation of airspeed between 90 knots and 100 knots for the remainder of the recording, during the following 20 seconds the altitude decreased to about 5000 feet and then increased to 5050 feet over the next 10 seconds where it remained until the recording ended at 1.14.27. Witness Accounts (Air Traffic Controller Civilians). The aircraft crashed during the hours of darkness at geographical coordinates of 01\u00b0 17\u201916\u201dS, 36\u00b0 57\u20195\u201dE.", "probable_cause": "The probable cause of the accident was the decision by the crew to conduct the flight with a known mechanical problem and their failure to abort or reject the takeoff after receiving twenty seven cautions. \r\nThe following findings were identified:\r\n- A three chime alert occurred during the positioning flight from HKNW to HKJK,\r\n- Crew continued with the flight with a known fault,\r\n- No evidence that remedial maintenance action was taken after landing from that flight prior to the event flight,\r\n- No evidence of the anomaly being captured in the aircraft technical log,\r\n- At least one of the occupants during the event flight, possibly the PIC, had been present during the positioning flight and thus was aware of the three chime alert that had occurred then,\r\n- Twenty seven sound of three chime alert event occurred during the take off roll on the accident flight,\r\n- The aforementioned alert occurred well before V1,\r\n- The left engine exhibited high torque values (in excess of 120%) while the left propeller speed was reduced to the range between 45% to 55% rpm for most of the flight,\r\n- Crew continued with take of roll and subsequent rotation despite the twenty seven chime alert,\r\n- When airborne, crew contemplated turning back but eventually elected to continue with the flight,\r\n- Cargo weight exceeded what was indicated in the load sheet 36,\r\n- There was no evidence of any maintenance having been conducted on the aircraft since its Certificate of Airworthiness issue two months previously (9th May 2014).\n"}
