The pilot did not read back the weather correctly to Scottsdale tower. After descending in rain and turbulence, the pilot reported to Scottsdale at 1857 that 'we think we have the arpt at nine o'clock.' the plt was cleared to make a visual approach to rwy 21. The twr never established visual contact with the acft & was unable to make further radio contact the last recorded radar contact showed the acft at 2200 ft descending, 2 miles from scottsdale on a bearing of 075 degrees. The acft contacted the ground left wing & nose low in a landing configuration on a heading of about 300 degrees. The acft slid about 770 ft, losing the engines, wings & landing gear before stopping.
