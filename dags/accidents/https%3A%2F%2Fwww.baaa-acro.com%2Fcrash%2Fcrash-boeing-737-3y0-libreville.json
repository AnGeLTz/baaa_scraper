Due to low visibility caused by heavy rain falls, a landing was not possible and the crew followed a holding pattern of about 30 minutes for weather improvement. After landing on runway 16 (3,000 metres long), the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran at a speed of 100 knots, collided with a fence and came to rest 100 metres further. All 131 occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. It was reported that the left engine throttle lever was in a full forward position after touchdown while the right engine throttle lever was in the reverse position. The braking action was poor because the runway surface was poor and the crew did not initiate a go-around procedure.", "probable_cause": null}
