Shortly after liftoff, two witnesses observed what they described as a puff of black smoke from the right engine. According to witnesses, the aircraft turned to the left before crossing the departure end of the runway at low altitude and low speed. Subsequently, the aircraft rolled rapidly to the left and impacted the ground in a near flat attitude, with a high rate of sink, and sufficient forward velocity to slide or bounce about 70 feet before coming to rest and burning. An exam of the wreckage, including teardowns of both engines, revealed no pre-impact/mechanical malfunction or failure. The aircraft was estimated to be 80 lbs below its max design gross weight. Its center of gravity was computed to be 1.45 inches aft of its rear limit. The temperature was 101\u00b0 and the density altitude was about 4,000 feet. All eight occupants were killed.
