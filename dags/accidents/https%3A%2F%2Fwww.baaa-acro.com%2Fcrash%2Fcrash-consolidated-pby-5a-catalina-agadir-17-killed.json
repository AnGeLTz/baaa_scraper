The seaplane left Agadir Airport at 1930LT with a return time scheduled at 2200LT. En route, the crew maintained several radio contacts with the base when a fire ball was spotted on water off Agadir at 2055LT. The crew of the french submarine christened 'Astr\u00e9e' arrived on the scene (some 7 NM west of Agadir) within twenty minutes and met on site the Spanish trawler christened 'Javier Cloret' which was cruising in the vicinity when the accident occurred. The nose wheel was found during the following night but no trace of the 17 occupants who were considered as deceased. At the time of the accident, weather conditions were considered as fine with sky clear and no turbulences. All 17 occupants were killed and all 8 passengers were officers from the cruiser christened 'Jeanne d'Arc'.

Experts believes in the following assumptions: or the crew was trying to land or he did not sea the water surface while cruising by night."}
