After circling the field permission was given from the control tower to land. Runway 03 was used. There was a slight port drift which was corrected. After another 150 yards the tail came down and the brakes were applied to slow down. On application of the brakes the aircraft spun around to the left causing the right oleo leg to collapse, causing the aircraft to land heavily on the right wing. It immediately burst into flames and F/Lt Butts worked the starboard extinguisher but to no avail. The crew abandoned the aircraft and two minutes later the aircraft exploded. All three crew members were uninjured.\r\nCrew:\r\nF/O J. H. Crossley, pilot, \r\nF/Lt R. A. Butts, navigator, \r\nLAC G. C. Merril, wireless operator. ", "probable_cause": null}
