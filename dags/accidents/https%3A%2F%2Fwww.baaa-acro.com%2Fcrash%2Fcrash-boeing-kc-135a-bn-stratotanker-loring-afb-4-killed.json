Shortly after takeoff, while in initial climb, the airplane suffered severe turbulences and the number three engine drag brace failed due to a missing nut. The engine swung up in front of the wing, causing a severe roll to the left. The aggressive control inputs in an attempt to level the aircraft resulted in both the #3 and #4 engines separating from the wing. The aircraft then entered a 90\u00b0 right bank, plunges into the earth and crashed in a wooded area located 2,4 miles north of the  runway. The aircraft was destroyed and all four crew members were killed. \r\nCrew: \r\nCpt Kenneth Gomes, pilot,\r\nCpt Matthew Ramstsch, copilot,\r\n1st Lt John McCarron, navigator,\r\nS/Sgt Jimmy Tardie, boom operator.", "probable_cause": "Loss of control after the number three engine drag brace failed due to a missing nut."}
