While flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet by night and in marginal weather conditions, the crew informed ATC he just passed over AF NDB. Two minutes later, the airplane struck the slope of a mountain located near Petr\u00f3polis, about 50 km north of Santos Dumont Airport. The airplane disintegrated on impact and all 25 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that while descending in IMC conditions, the crew mistakenly tuned the ADF instrument to a wrong NDB, causing the airplane to follow a wrong approach path and to descend at an inappropriate altitude. The lack of visibility due to the night and clouds was considered as a contributing factor."}
