While approaching the area under fire, the aircraft initiated a slight turn to the right when it collided with the top of a hill and disintegrated, bursting into flames. The wreckage was found at an altitude of 1,155 metres near Acciano. While the copilot was seriously injured, the captain was killed. ", "probable_cause": "Even if it was not possible to define with certainty why the aircraft impacted against the ground, it is nevertheless considered reasonable that the impact occurred as a result of improper management of the manoeuvre by the crew, the result of an inadequate assessment by the crew of the flight altitude with respect to the top of the hill and the critical environmental conditions, characterized by the presence of strong turbulence, strong wind and visibility affected by the presence of smoke. (The cause of the accident would therefore be substantially due to human and environmental factors)."}
