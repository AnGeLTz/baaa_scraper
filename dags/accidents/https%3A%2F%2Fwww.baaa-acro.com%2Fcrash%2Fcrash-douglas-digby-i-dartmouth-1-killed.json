A crew was killed and all five other occupants were injured, one seriously.\r\nCrew:\r\nF/O R. R. Dennis, pilot, \r\nF/O J. G. Richardson, copilot, \r\nAC1 J. P.

He failed to counteract drop of the left wing by not pushing the control column hard forward sufficiently.

He attempted to take off again when all flying speed was lost and stalled while doing so. "}
