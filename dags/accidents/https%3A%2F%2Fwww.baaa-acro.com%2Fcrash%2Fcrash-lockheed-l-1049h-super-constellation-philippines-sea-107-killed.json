(22 minutes past midnight, local time), a Flying Tiger Line Inc., Lockheed 1049H, N6921C, operated as Military Air Transport Service Flight 739/14, disappeared west of the position 13 degrees 14' North Latitude and 140 degrees 00' East Longitude en route from Agana Naval Air Station, Guam, to Clark Air Force Base, Philippine Islands. A widespread and intensive search was initiated after the aircraft failed to arrive at Clark Air Force Base at 1916 G.m.t., its estimated time of arrival. The flight was officially declared missing at 2227 G.m.t. which was the estimated fuel exhaustion time for the aircraft. All occupants, 96 military passengers and a crew of 11, are missing and presumed dead.
