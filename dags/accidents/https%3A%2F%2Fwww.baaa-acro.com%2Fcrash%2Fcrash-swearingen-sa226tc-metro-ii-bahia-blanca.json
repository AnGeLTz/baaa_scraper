The approach and landing on runway 34R were considered as normal. After touchdown, the crew started the braking procedure and the aircraft rolled for a distance of 1,200 metres when it started to deviate to the right. It veered off runway, rolled for 150 metres then lost its nose gear and came to a halt. All three occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The aircraft veered off runway after landing due to the possible combination of the following factors:\r\n- A possible (but not confirmed) failure or malfunction of the left engine reverse thrust system,\r\n- Crosswind close to the maximums specified in the flight manual,\r\n- Lack of corrective actions on part of the crew who failed to identify a possible failure,\r\n- Inappropriate use of the nosewheel steering system.
