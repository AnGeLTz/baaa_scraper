The crew continued the approach and after passing the outer marker, encountered heavy rain falls and turbulences. On short final, the airplane lost height and passed below the glide, struck approach lights and the roof of a building. On impact, an undercarriage was sheared off and remained on the building's roof. Out of control, the airplane plunged into the earth and crashed in flames in a field located short of runway 16 threshold. Two passengers and all nine crew members were injured while 83 other occupants were unhurt. The aircraft was destroyed by a post crash fire. Three hours after the crash, the navigator died from his injuries. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the loss of height on final was the consequence of an excessive reduction of thrust on part of the crew, who engaged the aircraft in an insufficient approach speed and a subsequent descent below the glide. The presence of turbulences (downdrafts) was considered as a contributing factor. "}
