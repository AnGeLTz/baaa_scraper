At 0750LT, the crew sighted a Dornier bomber and elected to make contact. In doing so the aircraft was hit while turning to attack and presumably flew into an AA barrage of the naval escort. Damaged was caused to both planes and the belly gun trough of the Blenheim was badly damaged. One of the tires had been struck by AA but the aircraft made a good landing on return to base. Nevertheless, it was damaged beyond repair. All three crew members were uninjured. \r\nCrew:\r\nF/Sgt D. J. Innes-Smith, pilot +2. ", "probable_cause": null}
