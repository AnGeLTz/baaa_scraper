The aircraft touched down at 0456 Atlantic standard time and, during the landing roll on the snow-covered runway, the aircraft started to veer to the right. The captain's attempt to regain directional control by the use of full-left rudder and reverse on the engines was unsuccessful. The aircraft continued to track to the right of the centreline, departed the runway, and struck a hard-packed snow bank. There were no injuries to the two crew members. The aircraft was substantially damaged.", "probable_cause": "Findings as to Cause and Contributing Factors:\r\n1. Aircraft directional control was lost, likely because of negative castering of the nosewheel when snow piled up in front of the nosewheel assembly.\r\nFindings as to Risk:\r\n1. The crew members were not aware of negative castering; the aircraft flight manual and emergency checklists do not address negative castering.\r\n2. The emergency response to the occurrence was delayed by four minutes because of the lack of communication from the aircraft to the tower."}
