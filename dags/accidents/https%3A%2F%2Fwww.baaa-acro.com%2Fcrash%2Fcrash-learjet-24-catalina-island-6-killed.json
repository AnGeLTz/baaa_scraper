En route, the destination was changed to Avalon, CA. Unicom advised the crew of the wind direction and speed on downwind. Witnesses reported the aircraft was slightly high on final, but said the pilot corrected the angle of descent. The aircraft touched down approximately 500 feet down the runway, which was crowned (sloped upward for approximately the 1st 2,000 feet, then leveled off). The crew could not see the end of the runway at touchdown. The thrust reversers were deployed approximately 1,000 feet after touchdown. Witnesses heard the engine sound increase, then decrease, then increase again as the aircraft went off the runway and over a 90 feet bluff. Fire erupted immediately. Within 3 minutes, airport personnel arrived with firefighting equipment, but they were not trained as firefighters and did not try to stop the fire for fear of an explosion. No evidence of a mechanical failure/malfunction was found. Found left flap extended, left spoiler retracted and locked, tire marks on runway. Estimated gross weight: 11,500 lbs. Computed landing distance over a 50 feet obstacle: 3,100 feet. The aircraft was destroyed and all six occupants were killed.
