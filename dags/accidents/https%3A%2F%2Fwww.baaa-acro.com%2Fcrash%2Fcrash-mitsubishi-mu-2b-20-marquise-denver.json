After takeoff from Denver, landing gear would not retract. Pilot made several attempts without success. He elected to return to Denver. Pilot said that on final approach the right engine began surging and the left engine would not increase power. Aircraft made hard landing on runway, breaking left wing. Investigation revealed both speed levers would not function because engine prop governors and underspeed fuel governor reset arms, splined onto underspeed fuel governor shafts, were positioned on opposite side of speed lever actuating arms. Landing gear functioned normally during swing tests. It was later learned that right main tire had blown on takeoff 3 days earlier and required repair. Maintenance personnel opened the landing gear circuit breakers to preclude inadvertent gear retraction. Pilot said he checked circuit breakers when gear failed to retract. Both occupants escaped uninjured. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: airframe/component/system failure/malfunction\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
