The glacier was located near the 12,000 foot msl base of a 14,000 foot msl mountain near the head of a box canyon. Witnesses reported clearly observing the aircraft enter the canyon area. When the aircraft was nearly over the glacier the aircraft was observed to commence a course reversal. During the turn the aircraft stalled, descended rapidly and crashed into rocky 40\u00b0 upsloping terrain whereupon it burned. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot intentionally flew over an area of high terrain in which he failed to maintain the proper altitude and he delayed his decision to reverse course. A contributing factor was the pilot's improper inflight decision. \r\nFindings:\r\nOccurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: maneuvering - turn to reverse direction\r\nFindings\r\n1. Terrain condition - blind/box canyon\r\n2. Terrain condition - high terrain\r\n3. (c) remedial action - delayed - pilot in command\r\n4. (f) in-flight planning/decision - improper - pilot in command\r\n----------\r\nOccurrence #2: in flight collision with terrain/water\r\nPhase of operation: descent - uncontrolled\r\nFindings\r\n5.
