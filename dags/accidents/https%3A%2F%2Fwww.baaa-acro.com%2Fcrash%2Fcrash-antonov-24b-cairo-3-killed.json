Following five successful touch-and-goes, the crew initiated a sixth manoeuvre during which the pilot under training was supposed to perform a complete stop on the runway then to increase power and initiate a take off with one engine inoperative. After liftoff, while climbing to a height of some 50 meters, the airplane banked right to an angle of 90\u00b0 then crashed by the runway shoulder. The airplane was destroyed and all three crew members were killed.
