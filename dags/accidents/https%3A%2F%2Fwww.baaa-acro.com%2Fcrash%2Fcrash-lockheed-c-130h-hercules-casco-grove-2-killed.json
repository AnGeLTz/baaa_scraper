At that time, weather conditions were considered as good with clouds down to 400 feet, broken at 2,000 feet, visibility eight miles and wind from 210 at 20 knots. Because of the short flight, the crew did not take the time to align the aircraft's inertial navigation system prior to departure. Upon arrival to Casco Grove Airport, weather deteriorated and the captain elected to maintain visual contact with the water surface while the copilot and the navigator were monitoring the approach on radar. On approach to the airport, the crew failed to realize their altitude was too low when the airplane struck the slope of a mountain located about 3 miles southwest of runway 02 threshold. The aircraft was destroyed and caught fire after impact. A crew member and one passenger were killed while 9 other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": null}
