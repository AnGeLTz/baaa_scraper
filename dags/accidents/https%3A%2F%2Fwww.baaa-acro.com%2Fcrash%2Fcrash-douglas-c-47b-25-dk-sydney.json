The pilot straightened the aircraft and tried to take off at 100 mph which was insufficient to remain airborne. Another gust of wind hit the aircraft causing the aircraft to again swing to port. The pilot at this stage closed the engine throttles, touched down and attempted to stop the aircraft with the brakes. The slippery nature of the aerodrome surface prevented the tyres to grip, with the aircraft overshooting the end of the runway into an embankment at a ground speed of 20 mph, causing the undercarriage to collapse. \r\nCrew:\r\nF/O L. F. G. Bugg, pilot,\r\nF/O P. A. McPherson, copilot,\r\nF/O C. M. McInnes, wireless operator.\r\nSource: http://www.adf-gallery.com.au/", "probable_cause": null}
