At 1150 it collided east of Nettuno with an Italian Air Force F-86 Sabre which was taking part in group training of aerobatic maneuvers. The 26 passengers and 5 crew aboard the Viscount were killed in the accident, and the pilot of the F-86 parachuted to safety. Both aircraft were destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was attributed to 'an Act of God' since neither of the pilots saw the other aircraft before they collided. A contributory cause of the accident was deviation of the Viscount from the airway which placed it in a prohibited area reserved for military activities. 7 members of the board consider assumption that the deviation of the Viscount was the result of a navigational error on part of its crew.
