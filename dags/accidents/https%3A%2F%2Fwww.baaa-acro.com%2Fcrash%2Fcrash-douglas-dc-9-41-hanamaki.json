On short final, eight seconds prior to landing on runway 02, the aircraft was caught by downdrafts and windshear. Three seconds prior to touchdown, the captain regained control but this was too late. The aircraft landed hard, right main gear first. It rolled for about 1,860 metres before coming to rest on the runway, bursting into flames. All 76 occupants were rescued, among them 20 were injured. A fire erupted under the right wing following a tank rupture.  ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft encountered windshear on short final with wind from 240\u00b0 to 320\u00b0 gusting 26 to 47 knots. The copilot who was at controls at this time was not sufficiently experienced according to the operator operational procedures. Poor supervision on part of the captain and a too late recovery were considered as contributing factors. "}
