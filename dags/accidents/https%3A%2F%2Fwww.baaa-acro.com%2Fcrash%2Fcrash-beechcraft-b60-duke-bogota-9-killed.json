Three minutes after takeoff from runway 13L, while climbing to a height of 200 feet in VFR conditions, the airplane entered a left turn then descended into the ground and crashed into several houses located in the district of Engativ\u00e1, near the airport, bursting into flames. The aircraft as well as several houses and vehicles were destroyed. All four occupants as well as five people on the ground were killed. Thirteen others were injured, seven seriously. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot lost control of the airplane following a loss of power on the left engine during initial climb. Investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of this loss of power. The aircraft's speed dropped to 107 knots and the pilot likely did not have time to identify the problem. Operation from a high density altitude airport contributed to the accident. "}
