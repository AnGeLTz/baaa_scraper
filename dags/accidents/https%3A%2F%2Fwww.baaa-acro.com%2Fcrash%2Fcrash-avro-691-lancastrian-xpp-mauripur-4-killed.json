On final approach to Mauripur Airport, while at an altitude of 300 feet, the aircraft pitched up and down and then went into a nose down attitude. Out of control, it plunged into the earth and crashed in a near vertical angle near the runway 22 threshold. The aircraft was destroyed and all four crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Poor judgement on the part of the crew who led the aircraft stalling on final approach. The following factors were considered as contributory:\r\n- the airplane was probably overloaded, \r\n- the center of gravity was probably out of the enveloppe when control was lost,\r\n- as the load was not properly secured, it probably shifted during the approach."}
