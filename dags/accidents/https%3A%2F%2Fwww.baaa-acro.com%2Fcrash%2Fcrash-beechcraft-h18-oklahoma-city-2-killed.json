The aircraft yawed right followed by a steep right roll, contacting power lines with the right wing and subsequently impacted the ground. A post-crash fire destroyed the aircraft with the exception of both engines and a portion of the right wing panel. The engine failed due to lack of lubrication to the impeller shaft caused by blockage of oil jet due to fod. Oil line from scavenge sump to scavenge pump inlet had been replaced prior to accident. The aircraft had experienced maintenance problem (oil leak) approximately 2 weeks prior to accident. Source of fod is undetermined. Both occupants were killed.
