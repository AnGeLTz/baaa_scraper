Sixteen minutes later, while cruising at an altitude of 1,800 meters in good weather conditions, the pilot informed ATC about a strong smell of fuel on board and elected to return to Ayanka. Six minutes later, engine fuel pressure dropped while the fuel smell was still present. A minute and 35 seconds later, the engine caught fire. The crew reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing when, at an altitude of 400 meters, the airplane nosed down and crashed by an angle of 60\u00b0 in a small icy lake located 20 km southeast of Ayanka. The aircraft was destroyed and all four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "A fuel leak whose origin remains unknown occurred in flight and the pilots' decision to return to Ayanka was correct. However, the intensity of the engine fire did not allow the crew to complete an emergency landing."}
