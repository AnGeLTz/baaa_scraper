However, he filed an IFR flight plan and took off. During flight, the ATC controller advised the pilot of a level 6 cell ahead and noted that he had no report on its top. The pilot reported that he was 'not showing anything' on his radar. Attempts were made to deviate. Approximately 20 minutes later, the pilot reported the aircraft was encountering icing conditions and was losing altitude. After another 1 min and 38 seconds, he reported 'we're going in.' Subsequently, an in-flight breakup occurred. The wreckage was found scattered over a 1/2 mile area. An exam revealed that the outboard wing panels had failed in flight. Witnesses reported seeing either smoke or fire in flight before the aircraft crashed. Evidence of an electrical discharge was found on the outboard portion of the right wing. However, the pilot had not mentioned any encounter with lightning on this flight. No evidence of metal fatigue was found. All three occupants were killed. \n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight encounter with weather\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
