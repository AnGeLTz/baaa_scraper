The airplane continued to climb when, at a height of 10 meters, the left engine failed. The airplane continued to climb until a height of 50 meters when it banked left to an angle of 80\u00b0 then stalled and crashed at a speed of 170 km/h not far from the runway end. While all six passengers were injured, all three crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the left engine malfunction was caused by the failure of the 9th cylinder valve. Wrong reaction from the crew caused the speed to drop too low, causing the aircraft to stall and crash. Poor flight organization, poor crew training supervision were considered as contributing factors as well as the fact that the captain decided to takeoff without a flight engineer. "}
