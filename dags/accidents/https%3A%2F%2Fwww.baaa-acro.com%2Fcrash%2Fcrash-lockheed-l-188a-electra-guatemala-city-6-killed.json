Passengers were disembarked and the captain decided to fly to Tegucigalpa on three engines only. Less than one minute after takeoff, while climbing, the pilot reported a critical situation and requested an immediate return. While making a last turn, the airplane lost height and crashed on a residential area located 1,500 meters from the airport, bursting into flames. All six occupants were killed and 38 people on ground were injured. The aircraft and several houses were destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that a second generator failed during initial climb for unknown reasons. Due to insufficient power, hydraulic pressure dropped below minimums, causing the airspeed to drop and the aircraft to stall. The fact that the aircraft was not correctly trimmed was considered as a contributing factor. "}
