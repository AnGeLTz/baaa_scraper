About five minutes after takeoff, while climbing to an altitude of 5,900 feet, the engine n\u00b04 exploded. Propeller blades detached and the engine caught fire. Shortly later, the engine n\u00b03 oversped and due to an excessive temperature, the crew decided to shut it down and to feather its propeller. In coordination with Cubi Point Tower, the crew initiated a turn and started the descent back to Cubi Point NAS. Despite the airplane banked right to an angle of 60\u00b0 and nosed down to 15\u00b0, the pilot was able to continue the descent but eventually reduced the power on both left engine to ditch the aircraft. In a nose-down attitude (3 to 5\u00b0 pitch down), the airplane struck the water surface and crashed into the sea about 1,400 meters short of runway threshold and sank quickly. Ten occupants were seriously injured while five others were killed. The wreckage was later recovered. ", "probable_cause": null}
