Shortly later, the airplane banked left then entered a dive and crashed in an open field located in the region of Karawang, about 26 km east of Jakarta. Debris were scattered 2 km wide and all 37 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of this accident was the in-flight fracture of a spigot in the elevator tab circuit. This part had exceeded the 12,000 flight hours retirement life by 21,000 hrs resulting in a total life of 33,000 hrs. As this figure is higher than the total airframe hours flown by the aircraft it means that the part that failed must have been transferred from another aircraft at some point which was an opportunity to notice that the fatigue life had already been exceeded."}
