At 1035LT, the crew departed Kryvyi Rih on the return empty leg to Dnipropetrovsk. While approaching the destination, the crew encountered thick fog with very limited visibility. The pilot reduced his altitude, probably to maintain a visual contact with the ground, when the airplane impacted with its right wing the metallic pylon of a high tension line (160,000 volts). The airplane lost height and crashed. The mechanic was injured and the pilot was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a collision with a metallic pylon while the pilot was flying at an unsafe altitude in bad visibility. It was determined that the crew departed both Dnipropetrovsk and Kryvyi Rih Airport without any weather bulletin. Also, they were cleared for takeoff without such information. The people in charge to transmit weather bulletin prior to departure failed to do so. "}
