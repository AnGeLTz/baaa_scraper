The goal of the mission was to facilitate the passage of ships in the Laptev Sea. After overflying Peter Island, while cruising by night at an altitude of 250 meters, the navigator made a mistake, causing the aircraft to fly to the wrong direction. Approaching the shore at an insufficient height, the airplane struck the icy and snow covered ground, slid for about 180 meters and came to rest, about 38 km southeast of Cape Chelyuskin.
