Shortly after takeoff, the left engine failed and the pilot elected to return for a safe landing, but unfortunately, the runway was busy with a DC-3. The pilot was forced to make a go around, overflew the runway but was unable to gain sufficient height. At the end of the runway, the aircraft hit telephone wires and crashed in flames onto a house, killing a young honeymooning couple. The aircraft christened 'Petunia' was destroyed by fire, both mechanics were unhurt while the captain was seriously injured. He died from third degree burns ten days later.\r\nSource & photo: \r\nhttp://www.adastron.com/lockheed/hudson/vh-bdn.htm", "probable_cause": "Engine failure. "}
