Under the control of a guided missile destroyer, the USS Berkeley, the Tracker was investigating an unidentified radar screen. Within a few hours of the aircraft's disappearance Hanoi Radio reported that a US aircraft had been shot down in the Gulf of Tonkin to the south of Bach Long Vi Island. The time was good at the time of the loss and the sea was very calm, which might have made depth perception difficult for the crew. An extensive search was conducted in the Gulf for days, afterwards and on 1 February a four-man liferaft from the Tracker was picked up some 150 miles from the aircraft's last known position. On 14 March Lt Templin's flying helmet was found in the same area as the raft. However, no trace of the crew was ever found and they were all declared dead in 1975. \r\nCrew:\r\nLt William Stannard Forman,\r\nLt Erwin Bernard Templin,\r\nSN Edmund Henry Frenyea,\r\nSA Robert Russell Sennett. \r\nSource: Chris Hobson", "probable_cause": null}
