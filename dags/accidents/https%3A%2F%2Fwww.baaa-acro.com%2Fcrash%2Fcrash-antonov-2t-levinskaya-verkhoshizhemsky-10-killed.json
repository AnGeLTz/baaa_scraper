In the morning of January 21, weather improved and the route to the south was reopened. On the leg from Kirov to Sovetsk, while cruising at an altitude of 150 meters in a visibility of 2-4 km, the single engine aircraft collided with a second Aeroflot AN-2 registered CCCP-02142 and carrying 12 passengers and two pilots. While CCCP-02142 was slightly damaged and its crew was able to continue to Kirov, CCCP-01218 went out of control, dove into the ground (nose down 60\u00b0) and crashed in flames in a wooded area located in Levinskaya Verkhoshizhemsky, some 70 km southwest of Kirov.
