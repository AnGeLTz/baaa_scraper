On approach to Biarritz-Parme Airport, the crew encountered marginal weather conditions and initiated a go around. While trying to get height, the three engine airplane stalled and crashed in an open field, bursting into flames. Both crew members were killed and the aircraft was destroyed by a post crash fire. It is not clear if the crew was attempting a first, a second or a third approach when the accident occurred. It is also possible that the aircraft was struck by lightning as the weather conditions were poor at the time of the accident. \r\nCrew:\r\nJan Kazimierz Franciszek Lasocki, pilot,\r\nMr. Morawski.", "probable_cause": null}
