Unfortunately, the visibility was limited due to poor weather conditions and the pilot-in-command was forced to complete the approach with its radio compass as sole reference as there were no ATC or ground navigation aids at that time. During a last turn to join the runway approach path, the airplane lost height and crashed in a field located five miles northeast of the airfield. Four crew members were killed while four others were injured.
