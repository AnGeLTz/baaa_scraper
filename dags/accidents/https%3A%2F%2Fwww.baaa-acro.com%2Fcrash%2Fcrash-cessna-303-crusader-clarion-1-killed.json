Marginal visual weather conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was observed by another pilot waiting on the ground for the aircraft. This pilot reported that the aircraft was seen through a break in the clouds as it turned left, southwest, as if to establish a left downwind for runway 05. The aircraft was located in a wooded area southwest of the airport. An examination of the wreckage failed to indicate any malfunction or system failure. The aircraft impacted the ground in a nose low attitude and the wreckage was confined to an area indicative with a stall type accident. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
