While approaching Douala Airport, seven minutes before the ETA, the twin engine aircraft struck the slope of Mt Cameroon located 64 km west of the airport. As the airplane failed to arrive at Douala Airport, SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the airplane was found. The wreckage was found two years later in an isolated area. The pilot Lord Malcolm A. Douglas-Hume was accompanied with his son and wife. All three were killed in the accident.
