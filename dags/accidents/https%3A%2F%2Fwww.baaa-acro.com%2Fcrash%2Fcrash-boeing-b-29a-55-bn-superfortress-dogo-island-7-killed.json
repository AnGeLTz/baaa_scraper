While cruising in a formation of several B-29 bombers, the crew encountered an engine failure and the captain decided to return to his base. Unable to maintain a safe altitude, it was decided to jettison the bombs. A 500 pounds bomb hung up in the racks and while attempting to release the bomb, it detonated either within the bomb bay or immediately beneath the belly of the plane. Out of control, the aircraft christened 'Hoxie's Hoax' crashed into the Japan Sea off the D\u014dgo Island. Seven crew members were killed while five others were rescued in their dinghy about two days later. \nCrew (325th BS):\nS/Sgt Gilbert Bear, \n1st Lt Neil A. Chapman, \u2020\nS/Sgt Claude M.
