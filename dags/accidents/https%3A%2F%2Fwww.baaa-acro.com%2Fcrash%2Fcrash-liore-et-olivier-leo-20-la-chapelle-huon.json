The pilot decided to land as quick as possible but due to low visibility, he was unable to find a suitable terrain. Several flares were pulled and the pilote eventually decided to land in a field that seems suitable for him. Just before landing, the aircraft was caught by a downdraft and impacted the ground. The right main gear and the right engine were torn off and the aircraft came to rest. All four occupants were uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.\r\nCrew:\r\nLt Foucher, pilot,\r\nSgt Deschodt, pilot, \r\nSgt Robin, gunner,\r\nSgt Cl\u00e9ment, navigator.", "probable_cause": null}
