A level 5 thunderstorm was present 8 miles west. The aircraft descended at rates up to 13,800 feet per minute. Witnesses saw aircraft exit bottom of clouds at approximately 4,000 feet in a near flat attitude and rotating around the yaw axis to the left. Engine sounds increased and decreased as the aircraft rotated and all components appeared to be present on the aircraft. No smoke or flame was visible. At approximately 500 feet above the water the rotation stopped and the nose dropped to a 30 to 70\u00b0 nose down angle and both engines could be heard increasing in power. Before the recovery could be completed the acft struck the ocean. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
