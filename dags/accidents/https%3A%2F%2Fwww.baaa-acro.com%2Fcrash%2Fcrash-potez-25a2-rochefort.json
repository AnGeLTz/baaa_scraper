They flew in two formations of six. At Rochefort Airport, several aircraft from the 2nd formation landed at the same time. Upon landing, the Potez 25 registered 2175 and flown by Sgt Chanal banked very slightly right, but that was enough to create a slipstream that hit the Potez 25 registered 2022, that landed on its left wheel. It rolled for few dozen metres before coming to rest upside down. Both crew members evacuated safely.\r\nCrew:\r\nSgt Maurice Pelastaing, pilot,\r\nSgt Roger Borrel, mechanic.
