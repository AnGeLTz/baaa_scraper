At 1055, they were cleared to descend at pilot's discretion to maintain 12,000 feet. Approximately 8 minutes later, shortly after beginning a descent, the flight was instructed to change frequency; but 21 seconds later, they replied 'standby please,' then radio and radar contact were lost. Wreckage was found approximately 26 miles east of the destination airport in mountains. An examination revealed the empennage had separated in flight; pieces of it were found up to one mile away with indication of overload failure. There was evidence that: engines were not operating at ground impact, ignition switches were engaged; left engine start switch was in the 'air' start position and right switch was beyond the 'ground' start position; right propeller was feathered; pax oxygen masks were deployed, indicating cabin had depressurized above 15,000 feet. Weather info indicated cloud bases at 10,000 feet with IMC and turbulences to 25,000 feet, mixed icing from 20,000 feet to 25,000 feet, light rain/snow showers, widely scattered thunderstorms; approximately 15 miles south, 4 inches to 5 inches of hail fellat approximately that time. TPE331 engines had history of flameouts due to ice ingestion caused by impossible use of anti-ice/ignition. All six occupants were killed.
