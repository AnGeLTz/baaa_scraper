On final approach to runway 31, the captain considered his position was incorrect and decided to make a go around. Few minutes later, during a second attempt to land, he failed to realized his altitude was insufficient when the airplane struck a 96-foot steel tower, stalled and crashed in flames on a railroad located about 0,9 mile short of runway 31 threshold. The aircraft and the cargo were destroyed by a post crash fire while both pilots were uninjured. ", "probable_cause": "The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the pilot\u2019s descent below his allowable minimum altitude and his inattention to flight instruments while attempting to locate the runway visually. The Board concludes that this accident was brought about by the captain\u2019s disregard of the minimum altitude during instrument flight. It is evident that he was attempting visually to locate the runway tile flying at a low altitude under conditions of restricted visibility."}
