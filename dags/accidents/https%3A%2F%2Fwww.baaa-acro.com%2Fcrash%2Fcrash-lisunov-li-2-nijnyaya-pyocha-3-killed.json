It crashed 75 meters past the runway end and came to rest. Three crew members were killed while the radio operator was seriously injured. The crew was completing a cargo flight from Nijnyaya Pyocha to Arkhangelsk with a load of deer carcasses for a total of two tons. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the cargo was incorrectly loaded and unsecured. After rotation, the cargo shifted rearward, causing the center of gravity to move outside of the enveloppe and causing the aircraft to adopt a high angle of attack (high nose up attitude) and to stall. Strong crosswinds (up to 60 km/h) and a rushed departure on behalf of the crew were considered as contributory factors. "}
