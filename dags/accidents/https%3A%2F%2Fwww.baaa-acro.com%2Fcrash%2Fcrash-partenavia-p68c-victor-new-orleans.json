He reported that after the aircraft broke out of the clouds at 1,700 feet, he transitioned to a visual approach. He stated that as he continued, the approach seemed normal, except the VASI lights seemed too far down the runway. He remembered that just before impact, the VASI was providing a red over red indication, but he did not worry as he perceived the aircraft was over the end of the runway and he was about to flare. At about that time, the aircraft impacted with water, well short of the runway. As the aircraft sank, the pilot escaped thru a hole in the windshield. Subsequently, he was found by passing fishermen. The pilot believed he had gotten a false perception of the runway location due to reflection of lights off of calm lake water.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: undershoot\r\nPhase of operation: approach - vfr pattern - final approach\r\nFindings\r\n1.
