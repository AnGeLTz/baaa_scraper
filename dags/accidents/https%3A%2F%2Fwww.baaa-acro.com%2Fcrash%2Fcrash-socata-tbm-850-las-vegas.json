He performed a go-around, but \"the wind slammed [the airplane] to the ground extremely hard.\" Subsequently, the airplane veered to the right off the runway and then back to the left before coming to rest. The airplane sustained substantial damage to the fuselage. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The automated weather observation system located at the accident airport reported that, about the time of the accident, the wind was from 270\u00b0 at 19 knots, gusting to 25 knots. The pilot landed on runway 20.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate compensation for gusting crosswind conditions during the go-around."}
