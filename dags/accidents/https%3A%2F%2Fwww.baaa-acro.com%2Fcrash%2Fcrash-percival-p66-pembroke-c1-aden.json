While approaching the Yemen coast, the right engine failed. The crew feathered the propeller and continued when shortly later, the left engine lost power and failed as well. Again, the propeller was feathered and as the captain realized he would be unable to reach the airport of Aden-Khormaksar, he reduced his altitude and ditched the aircraft few km off shore. After contacting the water, all five occupants jumped in shark infested waters and were unable to use the dinghies that failed to inflate properly. All were quickly rescued by fishermen and the aircraft sank. It was recovered few days later.
