Shortly after takeoff from runway 09, while climbing to a height of 400 meters, the crew informed ground about the failure of the left engine. The pilot-in-command made a slight turn to the left to 5-6\u00b0 and shut down the left engine 30 seconds later. The airplane continued heading 095\u00b0 to the altitude of 800 meters then entered in clouds. The crew informed ATC he was dumping the fuel and returning to the airport for an emergency landing. Shortly later, the airplane struck the slope of a mountain located 27 km north of the airport and disintegrated on impact. All five crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the failure of the left engine could not be determined with certainty. However, it was reported that the failure occurred at a critical stage of flight and created a complex situation to the crew who was forced to dump the fuel without appropriate assistance from ATC. The lack of radar equipment remains a contributing factor. "}
