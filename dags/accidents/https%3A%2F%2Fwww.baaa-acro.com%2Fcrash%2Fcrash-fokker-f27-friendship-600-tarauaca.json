The aircraft veered off runway, collided with several obstacles and came to rest in a ditch. All 23 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control after landing after the crew selected the power levers on 'ground fine pitch', combined with the failure of the antiskid system due to poor maintenance. The operator was facing enormous financial difficulties which affected the motivation of the maintenance, flight and cabin crew, which was considered as a contributing factor."}
