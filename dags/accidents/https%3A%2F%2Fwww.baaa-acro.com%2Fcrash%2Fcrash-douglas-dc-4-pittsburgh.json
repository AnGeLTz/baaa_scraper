The approach was continued visually but the rate of descent was excessive. The captain applied power, but before recovery was complete, the right main gear struck an embankment short of runway. Full power was applied and a go-around was carried out. Severe buffeting and a number three engine fire were experienced as the DC-4 circled for another approach. The landing was carried out safely and all 55 occupants were evacuated. The aircraft was later considered as damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration and lack of crew coordination. "}
