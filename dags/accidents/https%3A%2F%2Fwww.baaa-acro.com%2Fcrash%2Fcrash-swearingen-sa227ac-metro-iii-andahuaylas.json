After touchdown, while decelerating to a speed of about 40 knots, the aircraft started to deviate to the left. The crew counteracted but the aircraft continued to the left, veered off runway, rolled through a grassy and eventually came down a four meters high embankment before coming to rest. While all 19 occupants escaped uninjured, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It appears that the loss of directional control after touchdown was caused by the failure of the brake systems. The aircraft had already several technical problems with its brake systems previous to the flight, and maintenance was performed by technicians the day before the accident. For unknown reasons, the problem was resolved but no feedback or troubleshooting was performed on part of the technicians or the crew. The Captain was aware of the problem and took the decision to complete the flight despite the risk the problem may persist or happen again."}
