At 0105LT the Constellation called the Asunci\u00f3n control tower who cleared the flight to land on Runway 02 and requested the aircraft to call when on final approach. The last contact with the flight was made at 0115LT. From that time on a control tower employee reported the aircraft moved towards the south-southwest. He tried to sight it and noted that it headed towards the city, made a turn to the left and appeared to initiate its final straight-in approach. When sufficient time for a landing had elapsed the employee called attention to the lack of communication between the aircraft and the control tower. He continued to look out to the south where the aircraft would have appeared and saw a sudden burst of flame near the Paraguay Aero Club, south of the airport. Five passengers and three crew members survived. The aircraft was completely destroyed by fire which broke out immediately after impact. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was due to a piloting error in making the approach circuit on instruments. An error in timing resulted in the final approach being initiated at too great a distance from the airport. Proof of this was provided by the fact \r\nthat the landing gear was found extended, the flaps down, the mixture control set at 'rich', all of which indicated that the aircraft was in the ready to land condition.
