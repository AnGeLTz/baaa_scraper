An Italian passenger tried to escape and jumped out the cabin but fall in the ravine with his kid in his arms. The father was killed and his kid was injured. All 10 other occupants escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. It is believed that the takeoff was initiated with a tailwind component and the left main wheel or the left wing impacted an electric power line during initial climb. Some debris such as an engine (third image) were found 83 years later by a depth of 65 feet. \r\nCrew:\r\nEugene 'Smokey' Rhoads, pilot, \r\nMr. Holmberg, mechanic.\n\r\nSource and photos via Amado Aguiluz Ferrari, Coronel Jos\u00e9 Alfredo San Mart\u00edn and Carlos Rosa Mej\u00eda.
