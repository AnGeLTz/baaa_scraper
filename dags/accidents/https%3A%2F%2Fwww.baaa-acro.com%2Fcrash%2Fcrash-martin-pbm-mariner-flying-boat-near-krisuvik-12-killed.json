Following an uneventful mission, the floatplane was returning to base when pilots encountered poor weather conditions over the destination area. After circling the base while awaiting visibility improvement, the captain attempted a visual approach as no instruments were available at that time. While descending to a height of 800 feet, the seaplane impacted the slope of a mountain located near Kr\u00edsuv\u00edk, some 25 km southeast of Keflavik Airport. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and all 12 occupants were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nEns G. N. Thornquist, pilot,\r\nEns C. Bialek, pilot,\r\n2nd Lt William P. Robinson,\r\nAMM1C Vern H.
