While performing steep turns at a height of some 2,000 feet, he lost control of the aircraft that dove into the ground and crashed in flames in a field. The pilot was killed. It is believed that the loss of control may have been caused by two unidentified RAF Spitfire that distracted the Oxford's pilot by making a quick pass from his position. \nCrew (21st AFU):\nF/O James Smellie.", "probable_cause": null}
