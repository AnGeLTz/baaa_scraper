It stalled, crashed in a field and was destroyed upon impact. Two crew members were killed while the third occupant was seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "The inability of the aircraft to gain height shortly after becoming airborne, due to loss of engine power caused by ice formation in the carburetor intakes attributable to the captain's failure to make use of the heat controls. An extended undercarriage and the presence of snow on the wings may have been contributory factors."}
