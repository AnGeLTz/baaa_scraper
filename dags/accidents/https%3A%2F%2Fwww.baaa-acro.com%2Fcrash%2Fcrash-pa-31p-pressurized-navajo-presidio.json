No refueling was accomplished and he decided to go on to his destination with the fuel remaining. Enroute his right engine coughed and he realized he was running out of fuel. After switching to crossfeed normal engine operation was restored. Even though he was only about 3 miles from his destination he decided to land on a 4,000 feet dirt agricultural airstrip which he saw directly below him. He forced the aircraft down and landed downwind at high speed about midway down the runway. The aircraft did not stop on the runway and overran into a dirt bank and a fence. The landing gear was knocked off and the aircraft became airborne for 700 more feet before impacting and tumbling. The aircraft came to rest inverted about 825 feet past the dirt bank. A fire developed in the left wing and consumed most of the area in the vicinity of the left fuel tank outboard of the left engine. The pilot stated that there were no malfunctions of the aircraft or systems.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (partial) - nonmechanical\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
