He flew two ILS approaches to runway 31 at Minot and reported a missed approach after each. Radio contact was lost after the second approach. About an hour later, a snow plow operator found wreckage on the airport. Investigation revealed the plane had impacted to the right of runway 31 with the gear retracted and the flaps extended 15\u00b0. The 0959 weather was in part: 600 feet obscured, visibility 1/2 mile variable in snow, wind 110\u00b0 at 11 knots. No preimpact mechanical anomaly was found with the airplane or engines. All four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the pilot to maintain proper altitude during a missed approach.
