Following an uneventful flight from Nairobi, a clearance was given to descend further down to FL70 in 1,000 feet steps. At 09:28 the copilot reported that the airfield was in sight. Lusaka then cleared the aircraft to descend to 6,000 feet (2,221 feet above runway elevation) and moments later a clearance was given to make a visual approach for runway 10. At 09:32 flaps were selected to 50\u00b0. Suddenly, at 09:33, the complete right-hand horizontal stabilizer and elevator assembly were seen to separate in flight. The aircraft pitched rapidly nose down and dived vertically into the ground from a height of about 800 feet. The main wreckage was located 3,660 meters from the runway threshold. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all six occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by a loss of pitch control following the in-flight separation of the right hand horizontal stabilizer and elevator as a result of a combination of metal fatigue and inadequate failsafe design in the rear spar structure. Shortcomings in design assessment, certification and inspection procedures were contributory factors."}
