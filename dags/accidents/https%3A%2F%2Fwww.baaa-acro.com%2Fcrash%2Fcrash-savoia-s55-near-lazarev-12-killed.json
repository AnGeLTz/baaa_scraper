En route, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with reduced visibility. At 1158LT, the crew requested the last weather bulletin when radio communications were cut, about two minutes later. Too low, the airplane impacted high pine trees and crashed in a wooded area located in hilly terrain, some 80 metres below the summit. As the airplane failed to arrive at destination, SAR operations were initiated but eventually abandoned few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the 12 occupants was found. The wreckage was found by hunters in September 1935, some 67 km from Lazarev. A watch relatively intact was found on site, indicating 1200LT. In 2016, human remains were repatriated and buried in a cemetery in Khabarovsk. \r\nCrew:\r\nAlexander Svetogorov, pilot,\r\nMr. Efremov, radio operator,\r\nMr. Stychenko, flight engineer.\r\nPassengers:\r\nAnton Vasilievich Sheremetiev, \r\nStepan Shchetinin,\r\nMr. Baraksin,\r\nMrs. Baraksin + one infant, \r\nMr. Granovsky,\r\nMrs. Dokuchaev,\r\nMr. Kornyshen,\r\nMr. Mednis.\n\r\nSource: http://amurmedia.ru/story/savoya/", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain while cruising at an unsafe altitude in limited visibility."}
