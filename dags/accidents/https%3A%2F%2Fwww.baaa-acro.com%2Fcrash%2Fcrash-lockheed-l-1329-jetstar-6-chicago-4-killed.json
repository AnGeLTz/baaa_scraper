Decision to abandon the takeoff procedure was taken too late. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran at a speed of about 60-80 knots, crossed a perimeter road, went through a fence, struck an ILS antenna and came to rest in flames against concrete blocks. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Collision with fence posts after an aborted takeoff. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Delayed action in aborting takeoff, \r\n- Inadequate preflight preparation,\r\n- Lack of familiarity with aircraft,\r\n- Ran off the end of runway, \r\n- Pilot-in-command flew JetStar version 8 and never flew the 6 version which has 1,200 lbs less thrust than the 8 version."}
