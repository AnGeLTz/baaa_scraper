En route deteriorating weather was encountered and an IFR flight plan was filed to a revised destination. Clearance was received for a VOR approach and the pilot was advised of 1/2 mile visibility in snow and fog. A missed approach was reported over the unicom frequency. Impact occurred with a heading of about 170\u00b0 at 7,700 feet msl in mountainous terrain on the 173\u00b0 radial, 7.3 miles from the VOR. The inbound course to the final approach fix was 170\u00b0 with an inbound final approach course of 196\u00b0. Airport elevation was 5,914 feet msl. The airport was located on the 196\u00b0 radial, 5.5 miles from the VOR final approach fix. The VOR approach to runway 21 called for a missed approach to be executed at 5.5 DME from the VOR and a minimum descent altitude of 6,600 feet. All five occupants were killed.
