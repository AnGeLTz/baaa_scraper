During the landing roll, the aircraft overran the displaced threshold then veered to the right and veered off runway. While contacting a grassy area, the aircraft collided with several parked excavator equipment and trucks. The aircraft came to a halt and was severely damaged to both wings and engines. All six occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The accident resulted as the crew was not updated on the information available on the reduced runway length.\r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n1.

The runway markings and lighting not depicting the displaced threshold.\r\n5. The entire runway lighting was ON beyond the displaced threshold."}
