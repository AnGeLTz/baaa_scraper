Following a wrong approach configuration, the aircraft landed nose first. On touchdown, the nose gear collapsed and the airplane slid on its nose for several meters before both mains gears collapsed as well. The airplane slid on its belly for dozen meters, veered off runway to the left and came to rest in a grassy area. All 60 occupants were evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the captain who failed to follow several points of the approach procedure. The following factors were reported:\r\n- The plane landed in a nose-down attitude, causing the nose gear to touchdown first and to collapse due to excessive g loads, \r\n- The flaps were down at an angle of 40\u00b0 while the company procedure did not allow more than 33\u00b0,\r\n- The approach was completed with a tailwind of 10 knots, the maximum allowable speed, \r\n- The captain failed to react in time and to initiate appropriate corrective actions.
