About one minute later, he advised air traffic control that he needed to return to Hot Springs. He then contacted the airplane operator and said the heater was not working. The operator suggested that he return for repairs. The pilot was then heard to say, 'oh, shoot!' No further radio transmissions were received from the flight. The airplane cut a 400 foot swath through trees, and the wreckage path measured 940 feet. With exception of a heater problem, no pre impact mechanical failure was evident. Both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot inadvertently allowed the airplane to descend and collide with trees, after he became diverted by an inoperative cabin heater. Darkness was a related factor."}
