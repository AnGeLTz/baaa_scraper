On final approach to Shabunda Airport, at a height of 300 feet, the right engine lost power. The crew attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft stalled and crashed in palm trees located 3,7 km short of runway. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and both pilots were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "On final approach, the right engine lost power, causing the aircraft to stall because the speed dropped. Investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the loss of power because the aircraft was totally destroyed. Nevertheless, the crew was unable to expect a stall recovery because the stall occurred at an insufficient height. "}
