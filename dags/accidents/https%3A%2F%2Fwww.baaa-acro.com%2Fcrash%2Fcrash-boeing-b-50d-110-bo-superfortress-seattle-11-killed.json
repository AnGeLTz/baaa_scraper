Shortly after takeoff, while in initial climb, the four engine airplane encountered serious difficulties to gain height when the right wing hit the roof of a brewery located about a mile north of the airfield. Out of control, the aircraft stalled and crashed in a huge explosion on the Lester Apartments building. The airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire fed by 4,000 gallons of fuel. All six crew members and five people in the building were killed while 11 other people on the ground were injured. The exact cause of the mishap remains unclear. \nCrew:\nLt Lloyd G.
