Communications with ATC controllers was normal. During a night localizer approach into Millville municipal airport, an ATC specialist observed the aircraft passing through the localizer track and issued a vector for re-interception. The aircraft was subsequently observed tracking inbound on course. The pilot reported crossing the om. This was the last transmission heard from the pilot and was routine. The aircraft crashed into a wooded area just beyond the om and was destroyed in a post impact fire. Post accident examination of the wreckage revealed evidence to indicate the left engine was producing less power than the right engine at impact. Both occupants were killed.
