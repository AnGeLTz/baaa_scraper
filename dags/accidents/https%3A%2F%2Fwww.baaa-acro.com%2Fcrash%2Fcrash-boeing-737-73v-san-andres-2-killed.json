While approaching San Andres-Gustavo Rojas Pinilla Airport, the crew encountered poor weather conditions. Due to heavy rain falls, the crew was informed by ATC that the visibility dropped to 4 km. On short final, flaps were selected down to 30\u00b0 then the autopilot system was deactivated. After passing 500 feet on approach, the captain repeated the procedures in case of a go-around would be needed due to windshear conditions. Shortly later, the copilot shouted 'go-around' but half a second later, the airplane impacted ground 49 metres short of runway. On impact, the undercarriage and both engines were torn off. The aircraft slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest, broken in three. Two passengers were killed while 129 other occupants were injured, nine seriously.", "probable_cause": "Execution of the flight below the angle of approach, due to a misjudgment of the crew, believing to be much higher, leading the aircraft to fly a typical trajectory of a 'black hole' illusion, which was experienced during the night-time approach to a runway with low contrast surrounded in bright focused lights, aggravated by bad weather of heavy rain."}
