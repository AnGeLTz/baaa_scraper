On approach, the crew encountered clouds and icing conditions. Cleared to descend, the crew selected flaps down to 38\u00b0 when the airplane lost longitudinal stability. Shortly later, it entered a nose-down attitude and plunged at an angle of 70\u00b0 and a speed of 230 km/h in an open field located 100 meters past the outer marker. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 24 occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the loss of control occurred in icing conditions while the deicing systems were switched off. On approach, when the flaps were selected down, the stabilizers were covered by ice and this caused the airplane to become unstable. At an altitude of 200 meters, control was lost when the airplane entered a nose-down attitude and the distance to the ground was insufficient to expect recovery.   "}
