The airplane was repaired and a series of test was completed before the aircraft would be released for service. At 1337LT, the crew departed Sukhumi Airport on a positioning flight to Kharkiv but encountered engine problems shortly after takeoff. The captain decided to return but on short final, at a height of 80 metres, he initiated a go-around when the aircraft stalled and crashed in a street located about 350 metres from the runway threshold. The aircraft was destroyed and both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the airplane stalled from a height of about 80 metres while making a sharp turn at low speed. It is believed that the engine partially failed after takeoff, probably because the radiator was not properly repaired. "}
