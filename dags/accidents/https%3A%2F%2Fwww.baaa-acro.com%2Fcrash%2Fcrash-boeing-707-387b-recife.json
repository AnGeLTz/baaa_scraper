On approach, the crew was forced to lower the gear manually but it was not possible to establish if they were locked down or not. In accordance with ATC, the crew completed a low pass over the airport and ATC confirmed all three gear were down. A second approach was completed and the aircraft landed smoothly. Nevertheless, following a course of few dozen metres, the right main gear 'collapsed' and entered its wheel well. The aircraft rolled to the right, veered off runway then struck a concrete block, causing the nose gear to collapse. All 168 occupants were evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
