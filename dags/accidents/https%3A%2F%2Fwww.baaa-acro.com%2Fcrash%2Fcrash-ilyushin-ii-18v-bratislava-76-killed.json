This caused the airplane to be unstable while its speed varied from 435 to 225 km/h. Flaps were directly selected from zero to full down position, which caused the airplane's speed to decrease. Reverse thrust were activated on both engines n\u00b02 and 3 below the altitude of 1,000 metres. At this time, the engine n\u00b03 failed and in a certain confusion, the crew inadvertently feathered the propeller on engine n\u00b04. During the last segment, about 50 metres above the runway threshold, the captain considered a missed approach and decided to initiate a go-around manoeuvre. The airplane climbed to an altitude of 40 metres and turn to the right when the engine n\u00b04 was restarted. The airplane rolled to the right then stalled and crashed in the Zlat\u00e9 piersky Lake located one km short of runway 13 threshold, northwest of the airport. Four passengers were rescued while 75 other occupants were killed. Few hours later, one of the survivor died from his injuries.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who failed to follow the approved procedures. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Poor approach planning, \r\n- Poor crew coordination, \r\n- Unstable approach,\r\n- Failure of the n\u00b03 engine,  \r\n- Reverse thrust activated on engines n\u00b02 and 3 at an unsafe altitude, \r\n- Propeller on engine n\u00b04 inadvertently feathered on approach,\r\n- Inappropriate decisions on part of the captain,\r\n- Poor flight supervision."}
