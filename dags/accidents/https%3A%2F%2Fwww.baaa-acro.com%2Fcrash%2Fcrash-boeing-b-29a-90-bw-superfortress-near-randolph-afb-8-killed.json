Results of the collision were such that the tail section of the rammed aircraft, No. 44-62223, separated from the fuselage, rendering this aircraft uncontrollable.  Portions of the ramming aircraft, No. 44-87774, found along the flight path following the collision, indicated a strong possibility that all personnel in the forward section of this aircraft were incapacitated.  Both aircraft crashed with all personnel aboard.\nCrew on board 44-87774 were:\nM/Sgt Clyde L. Arnold, instructor engineer,\nCpl Wallace L. Bertog, flight engineer,\nPfc Donald L.
