On approach at dusk, the crew twice lost visual contact with the runway lighting. Instead of initiating a go-around, the pilot-in-command decided to continue the approach when the airplane touched down in deep snow (one meter deep) about 32 metres to the left of the runway. On impact, the nose gear collapsed, the lower part of the nose was damaged and the long-range fuel tanks in the cabin broke away, hit and killed two passengers. The other 11 occupants were injured and the airplane was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the approach configuration was wrong and that the pilot-in-command failed to react to the copilot calls.
