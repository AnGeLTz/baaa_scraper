Shortly after takeoff, while climbing, the right engine suffered a loss of power. The captain informed ATC and elected to return for an emergency landing but the aircraft stalled, hit tree tops and crashed in a wooded area located in Alameda, north of the airport. The aircraft was destroyed and all three crew members were injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the right engine suffered a loss of power during initial climb for unknown reason. Apparently following a misunderstanding and a wrong judgement of the situation, the crew feathered the propeller and shot down the left engine that was running correctly. With the left engine shut down and the right engine misfiring, the crew was unable to climb safely. "}
