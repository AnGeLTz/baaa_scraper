On final, ATC confirmed to the pilot that the left main gear was not down. After touchdown, the airplane veered to the left and came to rest in a grassy area. While all seven crew members were uninjured, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The hydraulics failure was caused by an attachment securing the recovery spring cable to the lower end of the leg broke during retraction of the gear. The loose spring was caught between the hydraulic cylinder and other linkages, and the piston was pushed to one side of the cylinder, causing an escape of hydraulic fluid."}
