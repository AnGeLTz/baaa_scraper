The pilot reported that he observed the wind sock was parallel to the runway but failed to initially observe that he was landing with a nearly direct 20 to 25 knot tailwind. The airplane touched down long, overran the runway's departure end, collided with a pole and caught on fire. All three occupants escaped with minor injuries. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's selection of the wrong landing runway and his failure to attain the proper touchdown location. Factors which contributed to the accident were related to the pilot's inadequate observations of the weather and the tailwind condition which existed."}
