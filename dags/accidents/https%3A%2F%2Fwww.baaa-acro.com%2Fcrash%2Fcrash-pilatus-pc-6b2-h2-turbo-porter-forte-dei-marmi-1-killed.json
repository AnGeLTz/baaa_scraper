Once the altitude of 13,000 feet was reached, all 10 skydivers jumped. During the descent, the aircraft became unstable, entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in the sea about 50 metres off Forte dei Marmi. The aircraft was totally destroyed and the pilot was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident occurred due to a loss of control of the aircraft following the separation of the right wing, due to the structural failure produced at the sub-wing attack of the bracing section. In particular, in the light of what has been highlighted, it is believed that the accident was caused by a fatigue damage mechanism which, developed without being detected, significantly reducing the residual section of the right sub-alar attack of the trunk. This suddenly led to the structural failure of the right wing and the consequent loss of control of the aircraft that crashed in the sea. "}
