On final approach to Dhaka-Tejgaon Airport, the airplane went out of control and crashed onto several houses located in a district 10 km northwest of the airport. All four crew members were killed as well as four people on the ground. ", "probable_cause": "It appeared that the hydraulic gust lock system activated in flight, causing the controls to lock. It is believed the rudder was blocked in neutral position and the ailerons in a upper position. Also, it is believed that hydraulic back pressure had built up because of a malfunctioning switch valve when hydraulics where armed on descent. The aircraft already suffered a major hydraulic contamination during a previous flight in the Azores Islands. On takeoff, both hydraulic pumps failed, causing a total hydraulic loss and forcing the crew to fly gear down to Madrid."}
