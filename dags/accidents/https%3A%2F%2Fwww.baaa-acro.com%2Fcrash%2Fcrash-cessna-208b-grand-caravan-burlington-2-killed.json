There was moderate snow falling at the time of takeoff. The takeoff roll was described as long and a witness saw the wings rocking from side to side after takeoff. The airplane struck trees one mile off the end of the runway, crashed and burned. Post accident investigation found snow contamination on the top of one wing that did not burn and the top of the horizontal stabilizers and elevators. No discrepancies were found with the engine or airframe. Both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot to de-ice the airplane prior to departure, and his decision to make the takeoff at a weight that exceeded both the maximum structural takeoff weight and the reduced takeoff weight allowed for icing conditions resulting in an inadvertent stall."}
