In addition, as the flight taxied for takeoff, the pilot was told '... VFR is not recommended to the east...'. The airplane impacted flat snow covered terrain in a steep left wing down attitude approximately 4 miles east of the departure end of the runway. The area was a treeless, snow covered flat coastal plain bordered by a sea frozen with white ice. The pilot had returned to work 4/1 after a 30-day suspension following a takeoff accident, and was assigned only to Cessna 207 'VFR only' airplanes. The poi did not discuss the earlier accident or the pilot with the operator's management.", "probable_cause": "The pilot initiated VFR flight into instrument meteorological and whiteout conditions. Factors which contributed to the accident were: inadequate supervision of the pilot by the company, inadequate oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration, the pilot's self induced pressure to conduct the flight, and the existing weather conditions and snow covered terrain."}
