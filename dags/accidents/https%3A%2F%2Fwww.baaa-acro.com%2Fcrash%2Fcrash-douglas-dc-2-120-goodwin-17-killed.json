The aircraft was destroyed and all 17 occupants were killed. While there was no post crash fire, a flash bulb from a photographers camera did ignite gasoline that had spilled. This was the first fatal commercial aircraft accident in the state of Arkansas.\r\nCrew:\r\nGerald V.

Despite the lack of evidence of interference with the pilots, the Bureau subsequently issued a directive that prohibited entry by passengers into the cockpit of US commercial aircraft at any time during a flight. The cause of the crash was never proven, due in part to the fire and the extensive looting of the site by local residents. Another report indicates that only the copilot was in the cockpit at the time and there was thought of a passenger disturbance."}
