While flying at low altitude in marginal weather conditions, the aircraft went out of control and crashed in an open field, killing both occupants.", "probable_cause": "AAIC reported its conclusion that the accident resulted from low flying and bad weather. Subsequently T. D. J. Leech, lecturer in civil engineering, University of Sydney, built a scale model of the Quaker's Hill area and tested it in the G. A. Taylor memorial wind tunnel. From these tests, he concluded that the aircraft probably encountered severe turbulence when the loss of control occurred."}
