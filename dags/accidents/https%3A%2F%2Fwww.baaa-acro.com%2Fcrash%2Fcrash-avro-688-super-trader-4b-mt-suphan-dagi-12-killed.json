At 0814LT, the airplane passed over Gemerek at an altitude of 11,500 feet then Elazi\u011f at 0859LT at 13,500 feet. The crew reported his position over Mu\u015f 27 minutes later and the contact was lost at 0946LT. SAR operations were conducted and the wreckage was found six days later on the slope of the Mt S\u00fcphan Da\u011f\u0131 (4,158 metres high) located to the north of the Van Lake. The airplane disintegrated on impact and all 12 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The aircraft, flying on instruments, drifted north of its normal track because of strong winds and crashed into the mountain. Contributing factors were:\r\n- The winds were stronger than forecast,\r\n- An accurate bearing could not be obtained at Mu\u015f, and Van had not been checked,\r\n- Sub-normal temperatures would result in a high indicated altimeter reading,\r\n- Calculations on the flight and contacts with beacons were not coordinated and controlled."}
