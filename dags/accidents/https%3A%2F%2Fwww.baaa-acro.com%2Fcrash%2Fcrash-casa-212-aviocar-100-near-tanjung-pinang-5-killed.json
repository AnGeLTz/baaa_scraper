The SDO is the pilot could not perceived rightly his position motion and attitude to the earth horizontal or to his aircraft or other aircraft and could as the dangerous precondition for unsafe action. \r\n\u2022 The Director (DGCA) decree No 30/II/200 issued on 20 February 2009 stated that for issuing medical certificate for pilot after 60th birthday require several additional medical examination items.
