The aircraft became airborne about two thirds of the way down the runway and the undercarriage was retracted. About this time black smoke was seen coming from the No. 1 engine. The aircraft instead of turning to starboard as instructed by the Ground Control appeared to drift to port. The port wing dipped steeply and at 1222-23 hours the aircraft nose-dived into the ground on the cliffs near Zurrieq and blew up on impact. The crew of 5 and 45 passengers were all killed. ", "probable_cause": "The probable cause of the accident was the failure of No. 1 engine. However, failure alone did not cause the accident, which was caused by loss of speed and consequent loss of control through an error of judgment of the pilot."}
