The flight was to have been for about three hours\u2019 duration. Weather conditions at the time of the accident were favorable. The cloud base was about 3,000 feet and visibility was over 5 miles. Two hours later the aircraft was seen flying at tree-top height near St. Denys Road, Evington. After circling for a few minutes it dived lightly and then levelled out. Immediately afterwards the port mainplane struck the roofs of three houses, demolishing the chimney stacks. A woman standing in the back garden of No. 26 St. Denys Road, was killed by falling debris. After hitting the houses it struck high trees about 40 yards distant and the tail unit and part of the bomb compartment were torn off. It then crashed into the adjoining field and distributed itself over a distance of 120 yards, killing the pilot and the 1st WOp/Air Gunner. Interviewed at the hospital next day, the 2nd WOp/Air Gunner., who was the sole survivor, said that a short while before the crash they had been flying round the telephone exchange at Uppingham.
