After being cleared for an ILS approach to runway 18, the crew continued the descent in relative good weather conditions. On final approach, the aircraft descended below the glide until it struck the water surface of Lake of Bourget and crashed one km short of runway. All five occupants evacuated the cabin and jumped in a 4\u00b0 C water. The aircraft lost its tail and sank by a depth of 33 metres. The stewardess suffered a broken arm. ", "probable_cause": "The impact with the water was the result of a loss of visual references during final approach during which the crew voluntarily brought the plane beneath the ILS glide slope, in an area affected by mist, on one hand and on the other hand due the failure to decide to execute a missed approach."}
