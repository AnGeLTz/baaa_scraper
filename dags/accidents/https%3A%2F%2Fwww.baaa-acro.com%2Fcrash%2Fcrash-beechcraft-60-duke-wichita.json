The aircrew notified Beech Tower of the problem and reported they would like to return and land. The aircraft was observed on final approach to runway 18 with the gear extended and the left prop stopped. Before landing, the aircraft began veering to the left. It crossed over the end of the airport at about 40 feet agl and 300 feet left (east) of the runway. The left wing and nose dropped and the aircraft impacted the ramp, left wing first. The aircraft then skidded across the ramp on a heading of 160\u00b0 and collided with and damaged three other aircraft; a Beechcraft F33A registered N1833S; another Beechcraft 60 Duke registered N6747D and a Beechcraft 58 registered N5800B. An investigation revealed that the #2 exhaust valve lifter had become flat and the #2 exhaust valve had failed from fatigue. Both pilots escaped uninjured.
