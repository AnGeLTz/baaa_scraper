The impact with the leader\u2019s nose severed the tail section and the aircraft went out of control preventing the seven man crew from bailing out. The flight leader had sounded the bailout bell and five men parachuted to safety. Parts of the severed tail remained embedded in the nose, pinning the bombardier and navigator in the nose of the aircraft and blocking the pilot\u2019s forward vision. The engineer went to the front of the aircraft, noted the situation and notified the pilot of the two men trapped there. The pilot, Lt. Slough, despite the damage to the aircraft, with the aid of the engineer in the copilot\u2019s seat, managed to fly the plane back and land at the base at Pueblo. These two men, Lt Slough and S/Sgt Cailleir, were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for their heroic actions.\r\nCrew (41-11826):\r\n1st Lt Gerald E.
