As the crew was unable to maintain the assigned altitude, luggages and cargos were jettisoned but the aircraft continued to descent. Eventually, the crew was forced to ditch the aircraft that crashed in the Banten Bay, few km offshore. Seven people were rescued while nine others including both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It is understood that the takeoff weight on departure from Palembang was 18,192 lb, which was over the 16,160 lb maximum takeoff weight. The weight of two ground fire extinguishers and a GPU which were carried on board as cargo were probably underestimated."}
