At 1332LT, while in cruising altitude, the crew contacted ATC and reported an engine failure. The captain elected to make an emergency landing and reduced his altitude when the aircraft entered a right turn and crashed in a field located in S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o do Pass\u00e9, about 50 km northwest of Salvador Airport. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact and all four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Engine failure in flight following a fuel exhaustion. It was determined that the crew failed to prepare the flight properly and did not calculate the fuel consumption correctly. Investigations determined that the crew calculated a fuel consumption of 100 liters per hour while the true consumption was 120 liters per hour. The following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Overconfidence on part of the crew,\r\n- Poor organisational culture that affected flight safety, \r\n- Poor flight planning, \r\n- The crew failed to feather the propeller following the engine failure, causing drag and contributing to the loss of control at low height.
