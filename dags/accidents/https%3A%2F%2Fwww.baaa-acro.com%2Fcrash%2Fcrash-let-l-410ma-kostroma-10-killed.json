After takeoff, while climbing in marginal weather conditions, the crew was instructed to report once the altitude of 1,800 meters would be reached but the crew failed to respond. The aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a wooded area located 11 km north of the airport. The aircraft was destroyed and all 10 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty as investigations were hampered because the aircraft was not equipped with CVR/FDR. Nevertheless, it is believed that the pilot-in-command lost control of the airplane after he suffered a spatial disorientation caused by the malfunction/dysfunction of the horizontal gyro. "}
