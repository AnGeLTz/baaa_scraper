After passing a night at Balagansk, the pilot continued on December 26 to Zhigalovo. As the airplane failed to arrive at destination, SAR operations were initiated but eventually abandoned after few days as no trace of the aircraft nor the three occupants was found. It is believed that the pilot encountered poor visibility due to fog while approaching Zhigalovo, missed the airfield and probably deviated by approximately 150 km in the area of the Kirenga River. Eventually, the airplane may have crashed due to fuel exhaustion. The wreckage was never found. ", "probable_cause": null}
