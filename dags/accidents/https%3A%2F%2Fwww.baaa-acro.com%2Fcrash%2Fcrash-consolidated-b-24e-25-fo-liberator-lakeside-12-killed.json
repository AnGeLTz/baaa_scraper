While cruising at an altitude of 11,100 feet, the Liberator registered 42-7183 that was on third position was left behind so its captain increased power to regain its position in the formation. Doing so, the tail of the 42-7183 hit the left wing of 42-7408. On impact, the number one engine of 42-7408 was sheared off and both aircraft went out of control, dove into the ground and crashed in a huge explosion. All 25 occupants on both aircraft were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nSgt Saul Becker,\r\nPvt Lloyd E. Fowler,\r\n2nd Lt Ray W. Gambol,\r\nCpl Lawrence A. Griffin,\r\nSgt Clyde Hewitt,\r\n2nd Lt James H.

However, investigators point out that the massive presence of ice in the region remains a contributing factor to the accident in the sense that aircraft performances were reduced."}
