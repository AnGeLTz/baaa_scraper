The minimum approach altitude before intercepting the ILS glide slope at the final approach fix/outer marker was 1,900 feet. As the aircraft was approaching the outer marker, the pilot was cleared for the approach and was handed off to the tower. After contacting the tower, the pilot was told to descend as published. At approximately that time, the tower controller and his supervisor discussed N700CM's altitude and proximity to the 727. The controller was going to discontinue the approach, but his supervisor suggested he wait and see if it would work out. Subsequently, N700CM crashed into trees approximately 5,800 feet short of the runway while descending in a wings level attitude. Radar data showed N700CM was well above the ILS glide slope when cleared for the approach. ATC procedures requested the aircraft to be below the glide slope before being cleared. Also, N700CM was approximately 2.57 miles behind the 727, but stayed well above the 727's flight path (and possible wake turbulence) until moments before impact. N700CM entered an excessive rate of descent before going below the glide slope. Both occupants were killed.
