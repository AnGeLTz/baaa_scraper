The Norwegian Scientist Roald Amundsen obtained help from the French government to attempt a SAR mission. On 16 of June, the seaplane departed Caudebec-en-Caux, north of France, with a crew of four on board, bound to Bergen and Troms\u00f8 where Roald Amundsen boarded with his pilot Leif Dietrichson. The aircraft departed Troms\u00f8 at 1600LT. About three hours later, the crew sent his last message, confirming that all was OK on board. While cruising off the Norwegian coasts, half a way from Troms\u00f8 to Longyearbyen, in the Svalbard archipelago, the aircraft disappeared while the communication was cut. SAR mission was initiated but no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. On 13AUG1928, a lateral stabilization float was found and all SAR operations were officially abandoned by the Norwegian Authorities in September 1928. On 13OCT1928, a fuel tank was found on a beach in Norway while a second tank was found few days later. This would be the only part of the aircraft ever found. In 2003, a Norwegian commission announced the aircraft probably crashed off Bear Island, in the Barents Sea. \r\nCrew:\r\nRen\u00e9 Guilbaud, pilot,\r\nEmile Valette, radio, \r\nLieutenant de Vaisseau Albert Cavelier de Cuverville, \r\nGilbert Brazy, mechanic.\r\nPassengers:\r\nRoald Amundsen,\r\nLeif Dietrichson, pilot.", "probable_cause": null}
