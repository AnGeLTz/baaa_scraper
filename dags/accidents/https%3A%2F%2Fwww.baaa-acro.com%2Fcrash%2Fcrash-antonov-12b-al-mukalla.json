During the takeoff roll on runway 06, at a speed of 225 km/h, the nose gear collapsed. The captain initiated an emergency braking procedure. To avoid a collision with the radio-technical equipment car, he steered the aircraft to the left. After it veered off runway, the aircraft rolled for about 400 metres and came to rest in a sandy area about 30 metres to the left of the extended centerline. All eight occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
