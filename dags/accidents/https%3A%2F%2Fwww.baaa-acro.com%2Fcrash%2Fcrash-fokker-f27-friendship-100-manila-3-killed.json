The aircraft was destroyed and all three crew members were killed while there were no casualties on the ground. The crew was involved in a local training flight at the time of the accident. ", "probable_cause": "It would be inconclusive for the Board to advance any definitive cause(s) of this accident. The airplane was in emergency a few seconds before it crash-landed. It is, however, deduced that the emergency landing was in all probability attributed to the error on the part of the crew, in that the attempt to relight the left engine, presumable during the process thereof, the right engine was instead, and unintentionally taken for granted. Factors contributing to the accident were the very short time and the relatively low altitude."}
