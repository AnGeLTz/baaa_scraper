The airplane was observed by witnesses at 400 feet agl in a 20\u00b0 left bank while maneuvering to return to the departure airport. The angle of bank increased to 60\u00b0 with a noticeable decrease in airspeed while the airplane descended below 300 feet agl. The left wing dropped 90\u00b0 to the left and the nose pitched down vertically. The airplane appeared to regain elevator authority and leveled out before encountering a secondary stall. The airplane collided with the terrain and was destroyed by post crash fire. Both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot in command's failure to maintain airspeed (VS) after a partial loss of engine power on the left engine due to failure of the n\u00b08 engine assembly cylinder. This resulted in an in flight loss of control (stall), and in flight collision with terrain."}
