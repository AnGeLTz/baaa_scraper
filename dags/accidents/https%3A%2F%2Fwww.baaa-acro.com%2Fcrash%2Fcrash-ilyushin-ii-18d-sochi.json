The captain decided to abandon the takeoff procedure and initiated an emergency braking maneuver. The airplane's speed increased to 250 km/h until the reverse thrust activated. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, lost its undercarriage and eventually collided with trees. 15 occupants, among them five crew members, were injured. The aircraft was written off. ", "probable_cause": "The decision of the captain to abandon the takeoff procedure was hasty as the takeoff configuration and all takeoff calculation were correct. It was determined that the speed's fluctuation at 220 km/h was the consequence of a brutal change it the wind direction and speed. Nevertheless, the aircraft was already above V1 and the takeoff should be continued."}
