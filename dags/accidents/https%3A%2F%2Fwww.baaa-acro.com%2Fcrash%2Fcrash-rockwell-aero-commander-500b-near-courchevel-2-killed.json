The aircraft departed London on 19 of December and the contact was already lost with ATC when the aircraft was flying over the Alps. As the airplane failed to arrive at the next stopover, SAR operations were initiated but eventually suspended few weeks later as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. On 5 August 1970, walkers found the wreckage on the slope of a mountain located near the Rocher de la Plassa, about 6 km southeast of Courchevel. Both occupants have been killed.
