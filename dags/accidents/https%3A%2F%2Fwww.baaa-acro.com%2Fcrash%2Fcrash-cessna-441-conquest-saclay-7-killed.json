It nosed down and eventually crashed in an open field located in Saclay, about 5 km southeast of the airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all seven occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, the visibility was poor due to thick fog. For unknown reasons, the pilot initiated a right turn after takeoff while departure procedures define a straight in climb. Five of the six passengers were automobile journalists flying to Montlu\u00e7on where they were supposed to visit the Dunlop facilities and perform drive tests on the last BMW M3.
