On approach to Tamanrasset-Aguenar Airport in the early morning, the crew encountered poor visibility due to haze. As he was unable to establish a visual contact with the runway, the captain decided to initiate a go-around procedure. Following a holding pattern, the crew abandoned two other approaches and after 83 minutes, he eventually attempted a fourth landing when, on short final, the aircraft collided with approach lights then a pylon and a truck before coming to rest by the runway. Two passengers and three crew members were killed while 34 other occupants were injured, some seriously. ", "probable_cause": null}
