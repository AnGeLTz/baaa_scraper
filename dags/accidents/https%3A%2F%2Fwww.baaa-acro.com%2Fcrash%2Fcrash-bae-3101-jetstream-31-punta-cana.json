Following an uneventful flight, the crew completed the approach and landing on runway 08. After a roll of about 1,500 feet, the aircraft deviated to the left, made a 45\u00b0 turn, veered off runway and came to rest in a wooded area, bursting into flames. All 13 occupants evacuated safely, among them two passengers were slightly injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of the combination of human and technical factor. During the approach to land, the crew observed a fluctuation in oil pressure in the instrument panel of the #2 (right) engine. After landing, the crew activated the thrust reversers on both engines without waiting for the Beta light, an essential indication to ensure a proper operation of those system. This configuration caused the aircraft to turn sharply to the left at an angle of 45\u00b0 because the thrust reverser system activated on the left engine only. The fluctuation in the oil pressure observed by the crew on final approach and the malfunction of the right engine was the consequence of an oil leak in flight."}
