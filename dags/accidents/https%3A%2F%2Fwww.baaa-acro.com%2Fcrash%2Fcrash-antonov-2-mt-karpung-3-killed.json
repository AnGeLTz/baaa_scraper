ATC tried to contact CCCP-47645 but without success. As the airplane was declared missing, SAR operations were conducted. Five days later, on February 26, the wreckage was found at an altitude of 450 meters on the slope of Mt Karpung (906 meters high) located about 140 km southeast of Pevek, 20 km south of the initial route.
