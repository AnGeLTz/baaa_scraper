After the German U-boat U-256 was attacked and sank to a depth of 110 metres, the crew was requested to take part to a SAR operation for a troopship reported to have been torpedoed. At 1220LT, the crew informed ground that he was returning to his base with an ETA at 1627LT. At 1515LT, all four engine lost power, the aircraft lost height and was ditched off the Irish coast.
