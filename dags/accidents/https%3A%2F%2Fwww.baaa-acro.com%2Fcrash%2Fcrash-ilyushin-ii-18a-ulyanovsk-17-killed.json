Following an uneventful flight, the pilot started the approach and when the flaps were selected down to 40\u00b0, the airplane became unstable. From a height of 120-150 metes, it stalled and crashed in a field located 1,240 meters short of runway threshold. The airplane was destroyed and all 17 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The approach was completed in cloud and icing conditions and it is believed that the loss of control was caused by the contamination by ice of critical surfaces such as stabilizers and elevators. The combination of icing conditions and the deployment of the flaps to an angle of 40\u00b0 caused the aircraft to stall and the distance between the airplane and the ground was insufficient to expect a recovery.
