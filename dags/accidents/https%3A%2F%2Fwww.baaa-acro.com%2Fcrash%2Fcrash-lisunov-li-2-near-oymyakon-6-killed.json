The wreckage was found two days later in an isolated area. The aircraft was destroyed and all six occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew failed to follow the procedures in flight and failed to pay attention to the fuel selector that was switched to an empty tank, causing both engines to stop. There was fuel remaining in other tanks but the crew failed to switch the fuel selector in due time. Due to fuel exhaustion, both engines failed and the airplane went out of control while flying in autopilot in clouds. "}
