Few minutes after takeoff, the captain encountered oscillations and difficulties to control the airplane so he decided to return to Buenos Aires for a safe landing. Unfortunately, it was not possible to land immediately because of the presence of ship in the channel. Following several circuits, the pilot-in-command attempted to land when the airplane crashed into the sea few hundred yards off shore. A crew member and eight passengers were killed while 41 other occupants were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was probably caused by a premature withdrawal of the flaps, a trend exacerbated by abnormal conditions affecting the airworthiness of the seaplane, particularly evident in the approach procedure, and a concurrent cause of inadequate maintenance of the aircraft, and the failure in the process of clearing the elevator control, established by seaplane maintenance manual."}
