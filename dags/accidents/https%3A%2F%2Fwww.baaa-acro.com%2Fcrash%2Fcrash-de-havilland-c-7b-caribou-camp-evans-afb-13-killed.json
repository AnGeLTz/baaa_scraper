The following findings were reported: \r\n- The crew failed to contact ground control at Camp Evans AFB prior to its arrival, \r\n- The crew was not authorized to approach Camp Evans AFB at that time, \r\n- The crew failed to respect the maximum altitude of 180 meters fixed for helicopters in that area and was approaching at a too high altitude of 335 meters, \r\n- The crew was approaching Camp Evans from a non assigned approach path for helicopters.
