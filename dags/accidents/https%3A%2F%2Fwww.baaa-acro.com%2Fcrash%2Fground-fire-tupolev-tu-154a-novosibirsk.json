At the same time, an oily rag was forgotten in front of the inlet of the air heater, which was subsequently drawn into the air heater, caught fire and was thrown through the sleeve into the aircraft cabin. The fire was not detected rapidly so it spread in the cabin and destroyed a large part of the aircraft. There were no injuries. ", "probable_cause": null}
