While returning to his base, the crew encountered difficulties due to heavy traffic and elected to divert to Dijon. Unable to establish a radio contact with Dijon, the captain diverted to Paris-Le Bourget but was instructed to continue to Tours. Short of fuel, the aircraft was approaching Tours when it was hit by Flak. The crew evacuated the area then attempted an emergency landing in an open field when the aircraft hit apple trees and crashed. Upon impact, it lost its undercarriage and one engine then slid for about 350 metres before coming to rest. All four crew members evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. \r\nCrew:\r\nAdj/C Jean Gobeau, chief,\r\nAdj/C Andr\u00e9 Schirmann, pilot, \r\nAdj Ren\u00e9 Mignot, radio operator, \r\nSgt Charles Lehrmann, air gunner.
