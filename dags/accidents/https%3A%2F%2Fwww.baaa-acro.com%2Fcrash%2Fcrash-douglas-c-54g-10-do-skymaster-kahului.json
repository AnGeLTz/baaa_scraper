At 0155 hst, the aircrew was cleared for a visual approach from 7,000 feet msl and a rapid descent was started with 20\u00b0 of flaps and approximately 25 inches ap (manifold pressure). The aircraft was maneuvered to intercept the ILS localizer and glide slope as a reference. After intercepting the glide slope at about 3,000 feet, the pilot-in-command (pic) called for 2,250 rpm and gear extension. While descending thru approximately 2,000 feet, he noticed the aircraft slowing down and descending below the glide slope, so he called for a power increase to 27 inches map. At about that time, the aircrew noted that the engines were not responding and had lost power. Subsequently, a forced landing was made in a sugar cane field with the gear in a transient position. The fuel selectors were found positioned to fuel tanks containing fuel, but the positioning during the descent was not verified. The temperature and dew point were 72\u00b0 65\u00b0 F. This would have been barely within the envelope for carburetor ice on icing probability charts. All three occupants were uninjured.
