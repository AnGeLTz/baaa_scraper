Due to poor visibility, the crew was unable to establish a visual contact with the approach and runway lights so the decision was taken to initiate a go-around procedure. Few minutes later, a second attempt to land was abandoned for the same reason. The captain insisted and elected to make another approach. On final, the aircraft descended below the MDA and struck the ground 3 km short of runway threshold. On impact, the undercarriage were torn off and the aircraft came to rest in a waterlogged area, broken in two. All 89 occupants were rescued, among them 50 were slightly injured.
