During takeoff/initial climb, the left engine lost power. The flight crew attempted to control the climb-out, but following the application of water-methanol, the pilot lost directional control. Subsequently, the aircraft banked to the left, entered a descent and impacted between the parallel runway. An investigation disclosed that the left propeller's blade angle was 21\u00b0. No preimpact system malfunction or failure was found. The cockpit voice recording indicated that the flight crew did not complete all of the items on the before taxi/takeoff  checklist. One of the items (presumably not completed) was a check of the h.p. cock levers. The checklist required that the h.p. cock levers be in 'cruise lockout' for takeoff. The left h.p. cock lever was found between the 'fuel off' and 'feather' positions. Movement to this position would have deactivated the auto-feather sys and shut down the left engine. Both pilots were killed.  ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (total) - nonmechanical\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
