On final, due to poor visibility, the crew was unable to locate the runway and decided to initiate a go-around. During the next hour, the crew attempted four times to land, without success. Eventually, the captain elected to land in difficult conditions. On final, the aircraft was too high and landed too far down a wet runway, about 400 meters before the runway end. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran and crashed in a ditch. Both pilots and a passenger were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew. Lack of visibility and wet runway surface (poor braking action) were considered as contributing factors. "}
