Weather conditions at Chittagong Airport were poor with a visibility of 1,800 metres in rain, 5-7 oktas cloud at 700 feet, 3-4 oktas cloud at 1,300 feet, 0-2 oktas cloud at 2,600 feet, overcast at 8,000 feet with CB's, temporary visibility of 2 km and wind from 180 at 6 knots. On final approach, the aircraft was unstable but the captain decided to continue the descent. After touchdown on runway 23, the aircraft deviated from the centerline to the right, causing the right main gear to veer off runway. While contacting soft ground, it was torn off, causing the engine n\u00b03 to be partially sheared off. The aircraft slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest in a grassy area along the runway. All 216 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who failed to follow the SOP's and his failure to initiate a go-around while the aircraft was unstable on short final.       "}
