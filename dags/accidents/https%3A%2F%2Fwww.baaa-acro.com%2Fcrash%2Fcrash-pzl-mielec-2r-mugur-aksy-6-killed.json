The decision to go around was correct but taken too late as the aircraft crashed at a height of 300 metres above the airport's elevation into the snow-covered slope of a mountain (2,123 metres) located some 7 km west of the airport. The aircraft caught fire and burnt out. While six passengers were killed, all eight other occupants, including both pilots, were seriously injured.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who decided too late to attempt a go-around while descending in poor visibility. As the crew was non compliant with the published procedures, this caused the airplane to follow a wrong approach path. Lack of visibility caused by poor weather conditions was considered as a contributing factor. "}
