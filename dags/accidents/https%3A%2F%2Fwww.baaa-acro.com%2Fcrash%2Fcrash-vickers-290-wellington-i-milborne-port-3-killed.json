En route, while cruising in clouds, the pilot-in-command initiated a turn when he lost control of the airplane that nosed down and crashed in a field located in Milborne Port. All three crew members were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nF/O York Plant Wilson,\r\nP/O Ivor Russell Barton,\r\nAC1 James Alexander Lowery.", "probable_cause": "The initial conclusion of the court of enquiry was that the inexperienced Barton was at the controls at the time of the crash and that he had lost control when trying to turn out of a cloud. Significantly the court also recorded that the Wellington had a tendency to become nose-heavy in a turn, that would develop quickly into a dive from which it could take considerable height to recover. These were early days for the Wellington and later it was discovered that it suffered from \u2018rudder overbalance\u2019 that caused the rudder to lock to one side and the aircraft to enter an unrecoverable spiral dive."}
