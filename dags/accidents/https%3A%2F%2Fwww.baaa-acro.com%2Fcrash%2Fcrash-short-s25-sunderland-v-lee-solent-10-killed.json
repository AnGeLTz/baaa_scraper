Immediately after takeoff, an engine failed and the pilot decided to return to Calshot. The first attempt at landing was aborted and the aircraft went round for another approach. However, in the dark and with apparently poor visibility, the pilot apparently misjudged his rate of descent and at 0448LT, after a flight lasting 22 minutes, the aircraft crashed into the sea 100 yards off Lee-on-The-Solent. All ten crew were killed.\r\nCrew (302nd FTU):\r\nP/O K. Dollin, pilot,\r\nF/O R. B. Couchman, copilot,\r\nF/Sgt Hamish Ian Sandison,\r\nF/Sgt R. M. Anderson,\r\nSgt H. Barker,\r\nSgt G.

Maybe the clutch failed as well in which case the reaction of the pilot was correct in not feathering the engine. It was also confirmed that there was no defect on carburetor, magnetos or plugs."}
