All five crew members were killed. \r\nCrew (4th AOS):\r\nSgt Walter Francis Godfrey Hobby, pilot,\r\nLAC Robert Charles Sharp, observer, \r\nAC1 William Charles Ellis, wireless operator and air gunner, \r\nAC2 George William King, wireless operator and air gunner,\r\nLAC Ciaran Anzlony Clarke, air gunner.", "probable_cause": "It appears that the aircraft stalled during initial climb following a loss of power on the right engine. This was caused by a false move on part of the captain who throttled back the right power lever while trying to remove his hand to select the undercarriage up. This caused the right engine to lose power and the aircraft to stall."}
