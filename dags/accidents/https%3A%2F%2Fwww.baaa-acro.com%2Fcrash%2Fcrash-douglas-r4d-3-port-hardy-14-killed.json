Five minutes after takeoff the pilot informed the control tower that he was returning because of elevator control trouble. The aircraft made a long final approach to runway 15 and at 1420LT touched the runway and bounced. At this point, the aircraft was observed to make an exceptionally sharp climb and it appeared that full power was applied. However, at the top of this steep climb, the aircraft stalled and fell to the ground in a nose-down attitude, the right wing striking first, and burst into flames almost instantly. The stewardess and three passengers were the only survivors. ", "probable_cause": "Because of a partially locked elevator, control of the aircraft was lost during an attempt to land. "}
