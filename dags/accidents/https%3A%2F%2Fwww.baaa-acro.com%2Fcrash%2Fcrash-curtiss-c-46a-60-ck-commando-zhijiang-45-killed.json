Weather was good at the time of the accident. The copilot reported prior to departure that the right engine magneto check was unsatisfactory. The captain considered the check as good and started the takeoff procedure. It appears the aircraft did not gain sufficient height after rotation as its total weight was well above the admissible MTOW. There were 46 soldiers on board, with their full package and ammunition as well. \r\nCrew:\r\nCpl Wayne N.\t Alquist, \r\n1st Lt Stanley Tosh  2. ", "probable_cause": null}
