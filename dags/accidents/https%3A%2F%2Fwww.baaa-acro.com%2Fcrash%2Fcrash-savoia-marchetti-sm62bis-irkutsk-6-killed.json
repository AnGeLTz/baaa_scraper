On the Angara River, the captain travelled a distance of about 100 metres then made a 180 turn to start the takeoff procedure. At this time, the distance between the airplane and the first building in the city was about 1300-1400 metres. At a distance of 30-35 metres from the shore, the pilot started the rotation and the airplane took off despite its speed was insufficient. It climbed in a nose up attitude then collided with a two-story house, causing the empennage to be torn off. The airplane stalled and crashed in the Transportnaya street. A passenger was seriously injured while six other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot decided to takeoff facing the city from a distance that was obviously insufficient.
