En route from Sheboygan to Appleton with six passengers and two pilots on board, the Twin Otter was descending to Appleton Airport. At the time of the accident, both airplanes were flying under VFR in an uncontrolled airspace. Following the collision, both aircraft crashed into Lake Winnebago, some five miles southeast of Appleton Airport. Debris were found floating on water, both airplanes were totally destroyed and all 13 occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "The failure of both flight crews to detect visually the other aircraft in sufficient time to initiate evasive action. the Board is unable to determine why each crew failed to see and avoid the other aircraft; however, the Board believes that the ability of both crews to detect the other aircraft in time to avoid a collision was reduced because of the atmospheric conditions and human visual limitations."}
