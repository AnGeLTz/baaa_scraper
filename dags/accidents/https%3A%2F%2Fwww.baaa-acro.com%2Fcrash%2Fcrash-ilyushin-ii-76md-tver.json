By night, the aircraft was approaching in a nose-down attitude when the nose gear landed hard first. It penetrated the floor just behind the cockpit.

All four crew members evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair as the fuselage was wrinkled. \n", "probable_cause": "It is likely that following a wrong approach configuration, the aircraft landed nose first with a high aerodynamic acceleration."}
