Registered 52-0981, the C-124 was en route from Kelly AFB to Tinker AFB with 15 people on board. Following the collision, both aircraft dove into the ground and crashed in a field located near Bridgeport. All 18 occupants on both aircraft were killed.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the collision was the result of an error on part of the C-119's crew who failed to respect the instructions transmitted by ATC, asking them to fly at an altitude of 7,000 feet. For undetermined reason, the crew continue his route at the insufficient altitude of 6,000 feet, crossing the track of the C-124 which was flying at the same level. Low visibility caused by poor weather conditions was considered as a contributing factor."}
