Unfortunately, upon arrival, weather conditions were not so good with light snow and a visibility of two miles. The captain decided to attempt to land but was unable to locate the airport and passed over without seeing it. Shortly later, while at an altitude of 75 feet and in a left bank of 70\u00b0, the aircraft hit the ground with its left wing, crashed and burned. All 13 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "On the basis of the above, the Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the action of the pilot in maneuvering the aircraft at a dangerously low altitude under extremely adverse weather conditions in an attempt to land. A contributing factor was the negligence of the pilot in planning a flight into an area in which adverse weather conditions were forecast without making adequate provisions for a suitable alternate airport."}
