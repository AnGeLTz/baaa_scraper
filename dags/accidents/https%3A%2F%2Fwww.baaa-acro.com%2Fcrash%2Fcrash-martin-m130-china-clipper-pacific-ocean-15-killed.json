Communication was not thereafter reestablished, and that no trace of the aircraft has since been discovered. A number of theories have been advanced about the possible basic cause of or reason for the disappearance of the Clipper. The Board has considered each of them. Some have not been disproved and some have been contradicted by the facts. However, the Investigating fecls that this report cannot properly include a discussion of conjection unsupported by developed facts. The Board, therefore, respectfully submit this report with the thought that additional evidence may yet be discovered and the investigation completed at that time."}
