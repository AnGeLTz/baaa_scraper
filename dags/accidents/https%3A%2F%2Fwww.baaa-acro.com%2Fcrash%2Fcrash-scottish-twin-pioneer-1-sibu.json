The pilot shot down the engine, feathered its propeller and attempted to return when the airplane stalled, struck trees and crashed in a dense wooded area located 5,6 km from the airport. All 14 occupants were rescued while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "The accident was a result of failure to obtain adequate height before returning to land, caused by the aircraft being outside the takeoff area and heading towards trees on rising ground; the initial turn to avoid these and subsequent alterations of heading to avoid further obstacles adversely affected the climb performance of the aircraft."}
