While overflying the Hanoi area, the aircraft was hit by a SA-2 surface-to-air missile. The crew decided to leave the target area and to return to U-Tapao NAS for an emergency landing. As the air gunner was wounded, the captain refused to bail out. On approach, as four engines were out of service on the same side, he was forced to initiate a go-around when control was lost. The airplane crashed near the airbase and was destroyed. Four crew members were killed while two others survived. \r\nCrew:\r\nCpt James Mack Turner, pilot, \u2020\r\n1st Lt Robert Joseph Hymel, \r\nMaj Lawrence Jay Marshall, navigator, \u2020\r\nLt Col Donald Arrington Joyner, radio navigator, \u2020\r\nCpt Roy Tom Tabler, EWO, \u2020\r\nT/Sgt Spencer L.
