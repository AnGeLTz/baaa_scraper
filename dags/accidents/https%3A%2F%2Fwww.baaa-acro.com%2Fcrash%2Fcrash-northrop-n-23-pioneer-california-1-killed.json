The crew, consisting of one engineer and two pilots, was performing a test of an experimental dorsal fin. While flying in the vicinity of an airfield, the fin broke loose and damaged the Pioneer\u2019s tail surfaces, making the aircraft uncontrollable. The test pilot Latham A. \u201cSlim\u201d Perrett did what he could to steady the aircraft to allow the copilot and an engineer to parachute to safety. Sadly, there was no time for Perrett to escape. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot was killed. \r\nSource: \r\nhttp://oldmachinepress.com/2014/05/17/northrop-n-23-pioneer-and-n-32-yc-125-raider/", "probable_cause": "A fin broke in flight and damaged the tail, causing the aircraft to be uncontrollable.
