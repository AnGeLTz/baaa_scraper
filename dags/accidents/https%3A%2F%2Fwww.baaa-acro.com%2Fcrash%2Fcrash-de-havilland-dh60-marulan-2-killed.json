Weather conditions deteriorated and both occupants, Cpt E. W. Cornish, owner of the aircraft and his pupil, G. K. Wride, were advised by Cpt Matheson, an instructor with the Goulburn Aero Club, not to continue the flight. Nevertheless Cornish elected to carry on and evidently Wride was in control when the aircraft, flying at around 100-150 feet, nose dived onto a stony ridge located 3 miles from Marulan. The aircraft was destroyed and both occupants were killed. \n\r\nSource: Ed Coates. ", "probable_cause": null}
