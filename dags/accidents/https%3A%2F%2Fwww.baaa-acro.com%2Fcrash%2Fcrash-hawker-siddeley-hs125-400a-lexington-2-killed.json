They were vectored toward the Lexington-Blue Grass Airport and circled to descend. Shortly after declaring an emergency, the pilots reported they secured the right engine and extinguished the fire light. As the aircraft was on final approach to land, the local controller (using binoculars) confirmed that both the gear and flaps were extended. However, as the aircraft continued onto a short final approach, an increase in its pitch attitude was noted. It then dropped below the level of the runway threshold and impacted in a pasture short of the runway. After initial impact, the aircraft went thru a stone fence, hit 2 utility poles, crossed a highway, came to rest at the perimeter fence and burned. An auto was damaged by debris; 2 occupants received minor injuries. An investigation revealed the aircraft impacted with the gear extended, but the flaps and flap handle were found in the up position. An examination of the right engine revealed its outer exhaust cone was cracked in the vicinity of a fire detection loop. No other preexisting mechanical problems were evident. Both pilots were killed and both passengers were seriously injured.
