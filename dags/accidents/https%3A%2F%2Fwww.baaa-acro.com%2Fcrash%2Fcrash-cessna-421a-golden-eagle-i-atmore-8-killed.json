Vectors were provided for an emergency landing, but the aircraft crashed in a wooded area about 3 miles from the airport. There was evidence that the gear and flaps had been extended and the aircraft had entered a turn before impacting. Both props had evidence of low to moderate power and neither was feathered. An exam revealed unsymmetrical wear on the blades of the right turbocharger; its thrust spacer, pn 406990-9004, was worn and there was evidence of oil leakage. The 13 qt, right engine oil system had only 6.85 qts of oil remaining. Both turbochargers had been installed during an annual inspection in april 1983 and previously had been overhauled. The aircraft was estimated to be 844 lbs over its max weight limit and the aircraft cg limit was exceeded by about 4.8 inches. Six of the passengers were not restrained by seat belts. An associate estimated that the pilot had only 4 to 6 hours of rest in the previous 3 to 4 days. All eight occupants were killed.
