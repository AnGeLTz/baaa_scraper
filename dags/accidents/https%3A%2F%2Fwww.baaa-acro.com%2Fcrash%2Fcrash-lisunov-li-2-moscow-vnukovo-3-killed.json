On final, both engines flamed out. The pilot in command pulled the control column back so the aircraft nosed up, stalled and crashed in a wooded area located 800 meters from the boundary fence. Three crew members were killed while four others were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "Both engines lost power due a faulty conception in the left fuel tank. It was reported that the admission of the fuel pipe was 41 mm above the bottom of the tank. In such circumstances, air was sucked into the fuel line when the fuel reserve passed under the admission mouth. Investigation revealed that 580 liters of fuel remained in an additional tank but the crew failed to switch. Finally, the reaction of the pilot in command was inadequate. "}
