The aircraft banked right and lost altitude. Shortly later, the right wing detached and out of control, the aircraft dove into the ground and crashed in an isolated area located about 39 km northwest of Balkhash. The wreckage was spotted 10 days later, on October 10, and all 15 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the pilot in command suffered a spatial disorientation while climbing into clouds. Also, the right wing detached presumably because of aerodynamic forces that exceeded its design."}
