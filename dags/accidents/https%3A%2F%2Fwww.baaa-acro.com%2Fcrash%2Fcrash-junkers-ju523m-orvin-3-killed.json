Approaching Augsburg, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with limited visibility due to snow falls. At night, the crew lost his bearings and continued over Augsburg until Switzerland. Despite the crew was in contact with Stuttgart an Munich Control, he got lost and continued to the south. At night and poor visibility, the airplane passed over the Jura until it impacted the slope of a mountain located near the village of Orvin, bursting into flames. The wreckage was found an hour later, about 300 km southwest from the destination airport. Two crewmen were rescued while three other occupants were killed.
