The pilot elected to make an emergency landing when the aircraft crashed in an open field located 3 km from the airfield. Both occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that both engines stopped simultaneously due to a fuel exhaustion. Investigations revealed that the aircraft remained parked at Valdepe\u00f1as Airport for five days without surveillance and it is believed that the fuel was stolen from the tanks. The pilot failed to prepare the flight according to published procedures and failed to realize the tanks were empty before departure. Nevertheless, he reported to the investigators that the fuel gauges were intermittently failing. "}
