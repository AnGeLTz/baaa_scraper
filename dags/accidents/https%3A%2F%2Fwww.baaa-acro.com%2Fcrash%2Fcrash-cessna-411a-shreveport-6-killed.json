He then performed another run-up before departing. This is evidence that he was aware of a problem with his aircraft. The engine(s) were popping and puffing black smoke during the ground run. Yet, the takeoff was continued. The popping and smoke puffing continued after liftoff. A noticeable loss of airspeed occurred during the climbout. The aircraft started the third roll (into the bad engine) before finally going inverted. The aircraft's allowable gross weight was exceeded by at least 205 pounds at takeoff, however, the center of gravity remained within its specified limits. Internal examination of the right engine exhibited evidence that it had operated at sometime on a mixture of gasoline and jet fuel. All six occupants were killed.
