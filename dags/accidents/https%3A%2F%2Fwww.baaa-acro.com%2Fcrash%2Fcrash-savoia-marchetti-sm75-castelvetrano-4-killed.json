At that time, the aircraft was heavily loaded. On a night approach to Castelvetrano, weather conditions were poor with low clouds and rain falls. The first approach was abandoned by the captain because he was unable to locate the runway due to poor visibility. The approach lights of the aircraft were out of order at that time. During the second approach, the aircraft was properly aligned with the runway but the speed was too high (160 km/h). During the last segment, the captain reduced the engine power to idle when the aircraft plunged and hit the runway surface. The right wing caught fire and the aircraft went out of control and crashed. Four soldiers (three Germans and one French) were killed while all 33 other occupants were injured. The aircraft was destroyed by fire. \nCrew:\nTen Alfredo Bonsignore, pilot, \nSgt Ugo Antonellini, pilot,\nSgt Armando Marchetti, flight engineer, \nSgt Beniamino Valobra, radio navigator, \nSgt Pietro Punzi, air gunner.", "probable_cause": null}
