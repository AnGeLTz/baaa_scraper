He decided to land past the runway but the aircraft hit a fence, lost its left main gear and slid for few dozen metres before colliding with trees and coming to rest in an orchard. The captain, the radio navigator and two passengers were injured while all four other occupants were unhurt. The aircraft was considered as damaged beyond repair as the right wing was partially torn off and the left wing severely crushed. At the time of the accident, weather conditions were poor with snow falls and icing that probably reduced the aircraft performances upon takeoff. ", "probable_cause": null}
