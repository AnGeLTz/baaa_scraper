After touchdown on a wet runway, the crew encountered difficulties to decelerate properly as the airplane suffered hydroplaning. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran and came to rest few dozen yards further. Both pilots were seriously injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Overran runway and collided with a dirt bank after the crew selected the wrong runway relative to existing wind. The following factors were reported:\r\n- Failed to use or incorrectly used miscellaneous equipment, \r\n- Hydroplaning on wet runway, \r\n- Airport conditions: wet runway, \r\n- Rain falls, \r\n- Tail wind from 158 to 202\u00b0,\r\n- Cleared for ILS circling approach while the pilot requested a straight in approach,\r\n- Landed normally in heavy rain but failed to deploy the drag chute."}
