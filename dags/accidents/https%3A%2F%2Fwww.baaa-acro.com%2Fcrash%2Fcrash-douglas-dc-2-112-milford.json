The pilot was unable to localize Camden and was unaware of his real position due to marginal weather conditions. While descending to 1,400 feet, the left wing impacted trees. The aircraft stalled and crashed in a wooded area located on a hill some four miles northeast of Milford. All 11 occupants were rescued and the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "It is the opinion of the Accident Board that the probable caused of this accident were: \r\nError on the part of the pilot for attempting to get down under the overcast without first definitely proving his position,\r\nImproper dispatching for clearing the flight into an area of predicted bad weather, particularly when the area cleared through did not permit a safe return, and \r\nStatic conditions encountered which rendered reception of the radio range signals over the airplane's range receivers unintelligible. \n"}
