The pilot stated that the approach was normal in moderate to heavy rain and he broke out at about 800 ft agl. He crossed the end of the runway with full flaps, was high, and touched down near the intersection of runway 20l and runway 27. This intersection was about 3,100 ft beyond the approach end of runway 20L. After touchdown, the aircraft continued off the end of the runway, went over an embankment and came to rest about 50 ft beyond the runway in soft mud. During the investigation white tire marks were found near the end of the runway. These marks resembled those made by hydroplaning action. The pilot stated he had trouble seeing the runway and that windshield wipers would have been helpful.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: overrun\r\nPhase of operation: landing - roll\r\nFindings\r\n1.
