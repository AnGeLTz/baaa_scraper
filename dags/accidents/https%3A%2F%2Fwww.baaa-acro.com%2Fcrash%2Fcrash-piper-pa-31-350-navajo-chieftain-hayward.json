As the aircraft descended the pilot reduced the airspeed and deployed flaps. As the aircraft neared the airport the pilot increased the flap angle and adjusted the propellers to the landing rpm and the airspeed decreased. The pilot stated that at this time he heard a noise that sounded like a flutter which he thought was emanating from the right engine. Full throttle was applied, but the airspeed continued to decrease and the pilot elected to land on a freeway. The aircraft collided with a motor vehicle on touchdown and slid to a stop. Post crash exam revealed the rpm control levers and bellranks to be in the high rpm settings. The left prop was found in the feathered position.
