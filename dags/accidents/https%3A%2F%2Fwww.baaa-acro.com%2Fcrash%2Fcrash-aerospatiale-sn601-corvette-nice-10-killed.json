On final approach to Nice-C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport, while completing a last turn, the airplane stalled and crashed into the sea about one km short of runway 05 threshold. Few debris were found floating on water while the main wreckage sank in a canyon by a depth of about 1,500 meters. All 10 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of a stall on final approach after both engines stopped quite simultaneously. Investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the right engine failure while it is believed that the left engine stopped following the failure of the accessory drive gearbox. This resulted from the evolution of fatigue cracks observed on other engines of the same type. "}
