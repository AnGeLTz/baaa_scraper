A comparison of recorded radar data and weather reports in the local area indicated that the pilot was maneuvering near the cloud bases in an area with low visibility and ceilings. Based on the erratic and circling flight path, it is likely that the pilot was having difficulty determining his location and desired flight track when the airplane collided with terrain. Post accident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.", "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s loss of situational awareness while maneuvering under a cloud layer and failure to maintain sufficient clearance from mountainous terrain."}
