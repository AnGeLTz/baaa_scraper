That evening, the group boarded the aircraft for the return flight. After takeoff, the aircraft was seen flying at low altitude in the vicinity of where the musical group had performed. The aircraft was observed at a very low altitude when it entered an abrupt climb, then went into a wingover or hammerhead stall type of maneuver and reversed direction. However, before recovering from the ensuing dive, the aircraft crashed on wooded terrain. Witnesses said the engines appeared to be running normally. A test of the pilot's blood showed a slight amount of alcohol; however, there were indications this was due to putrefaction. All 10 occupants were killed, among them six members of the 'Montana Band' and their manager.\r\nMontana Band members were:\r\nCurt Bergeron, \r\nClifford Tipton,\r\nAllen Larson,\r\nGrady Whitfield,\r\nTerry Robinson\r\nDale Anderson,\r\nTom Sawan, Band's Manager.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with terrain/water\r\nPhase of operation: maneuvering - turn to reverse direction\r\nFindings\r\n1.
