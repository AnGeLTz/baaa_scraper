The pilot-in-command elected to takeoff twice but the aircraft failed to respond. Twelve seconds later, the captain decided to abandon the takeoff procedure but this decision was taken too late as the remaining distance was 300 metres only. Unable to stop, the aircraft crossed the boundary fence then a motorway where it collided with several vehicles before coming to rest, bursting into flames. All three crew members were killed as well as seven people on the ground. Ten other people on the ground were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong takeoff configuration on part of the crew.
