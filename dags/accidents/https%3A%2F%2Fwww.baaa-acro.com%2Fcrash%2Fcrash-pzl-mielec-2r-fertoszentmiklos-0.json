Shortly after takeoff from runway 16, while in initial climb in a 15\u00b0 flaps down configuration, the crew encountered problems with the engine that lost power and started to vibrate. While completing a left turn, the aircraft lost height, impacted ground and crashed in a cornfield. Both pilots escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the result of a turn at low altitude and insufficient speed under the circumstances. The following contributing factors were identified: \r\n- High ambient temperatures,\r\n- The static load on the airplane at its maximum permissible level,\r\n- Dust filter switched on unnecessarily,\r\n- Unjustified use of carburetor heating,\r\n- Increase propeller angle in the given flight position,\r\n- Reducing engine power in the given flight position by taking back the throttle."}
