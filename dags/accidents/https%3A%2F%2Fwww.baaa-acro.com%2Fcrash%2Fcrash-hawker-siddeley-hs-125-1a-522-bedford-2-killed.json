Witnesses observed the aircraft approach runway 31 and execute a go-around before touchdown. The aircraft circled left to a runway 06 (almost direct downwind) approach. Touchdown occurred about 2/3 down the 3,100 feet long runway. The engines were heard to spool up to high power (no thrust reversers) but the aircraft did not become airborne. It overran the runway into rough terrain and caught fire. Investigation showed the landing gear was down, flaps were at approach setting and speed brakes were fully deployed. Both pilots were killed.
