The trainee and instructor were not able to regain directional control. The trainee then tried to rotate the aircraft although no VR speed call had been made. The airplane did not become airborne and the instructor took over control. He tried to add power on the no. 2 engine, but the propeller auto-feathered. The aircraft ran off the runway and crashed into an airport boundary wall.", "probable_cause": "The instructor adopted wrong procedure for simulating starboard engine failure during reject take-off exercise. The trainee-pilot could not recognise the emergency. He handled the situation incorrectly and rotated the aircraft prematurely disregarding decision speed. The instructor took over the controls without proper call out and he also continued for take-off with one engine inoperative on undulated soft ground disregarding decision speed and the circumstances."}
