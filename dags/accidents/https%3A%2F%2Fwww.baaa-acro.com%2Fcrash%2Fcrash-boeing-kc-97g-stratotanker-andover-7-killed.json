The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all seven crew members were killed. \nCrew:\nCpt James White, pilot,\n1st Lt Dean Holzworth, copilot,\n1st Lt Harold High, navigator, \nT/Sgt Owen Combs, flight engineer,\nT/Sgt Jake Schmidt, boom operator,\nT/Sgt Marion Ackermand, Scanner \nA3c Phillip Darst, scanner.\nSource: \nhttp://andoverbeacon.com/index.php/12064/site-of-1959-plane-crash-receives-an-american-flag/", "probable_cause": " The Air Force Accident Investigation Board determined after a thorough investigation that the cause of the crash was due to a loss of lubrication to the bearings in the #4 engine turbo supercharger. That led to a failure of the turbo supercharger shaft. The turbine, once unloaded, accelerated to destruction and caused the uncontained catastrophic fire, due to what would presumably have been severed fuel lines or punctured tanks in the wing."}
