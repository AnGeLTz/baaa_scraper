Two RNZAF Devon's registered NZ1810 and NZ1811 were engaged in a demonstration at Wigram Airbase. While approaching the airfield from the south at an altitude of 1,200 feet, both aircraft collided with their wings (it appears that the right wing of NZ1810 touched the left wing of NZ1811). Out of control, both airplanes dove into the ground and crashed in a paddock located about 700 meters from the airbase and were totally destroyed. All seven crew members on both aircraft were killed. \r\nCrew on board NZ1810:\r\nF/Lt Edwin Pattison Booth Ebbett, pilot, \r\nA1c Brian James Keogh, \r\nA1c Eric Melrose.\r\nCrew on board NZ1811:\r\nS/L Sholto Russell Duncan, pilot, \r\nA1c William Henry Sharman, \r\nA2c Russell Woodcock, \r\nLt Erling William Ziesler.", "probable_cause": "Wrong judgement on part of both crew members while flying in formation."}
