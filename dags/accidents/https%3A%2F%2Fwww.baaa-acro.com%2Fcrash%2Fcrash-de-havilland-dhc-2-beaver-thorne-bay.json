During the approach, the engine lost total power, and the airplane descended into an area of trees before reaching the lake, which resulted in substantial damage to the wings, fuselage, and empennage. The operator reported that the engine had been overhauled (zero-timed) 31 hours before the accident. A postaccident engine examination revealed metal fragments and heavy gouging damage to the rotating components within the crankcase. The bottom portion (crankshaft end) of the n\u00b01 linkrod and its respective bushing were missing from the n\u00b01 linkpin; the oil sump contained metal debris consistent with heavily damaged remnants of these (and other) components. The n\u00b02 cylinder barrel and linkrod and the n\u00b03 linkrod showed deformation to the left (in the direction of engine rotation). Based on the damage observed in the engine, it is likely that the event that initiated the engine failure involved either the the n\u00b01 linkrod bushing or the bottom portion of the n\u00b01 linkrod; however, the extensive damage to these components precluded determination of the failure mode.", "probable_cause": "The failure of the n\u00b01 linkrod bushing or the bottom portion of the linkrod, which resulted in a total loss of engine power."}
