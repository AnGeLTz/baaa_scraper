On final, both main landing gears were lowered but apparently not locked while the nose gear remained stuck in its main wheel. Upon touchdown on runway 09L, the aircraft sank on its belly and slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest. All five occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the hydraulic pump n\u00b02 on the engine n\u00b03 failed after takeoff, causing an oil leak and a loss of hydraulic pressure. The undercarriage could be lowered but not locked down while the crew attempted to lower the nose gear manually but doing so, caused the locking pin to obstruct and damage the landing gear extension system. It was also reported that several seals located on hydraulic lines were broken and have not been replaced during the last C check. "}
