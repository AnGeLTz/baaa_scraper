When the crew's efforts to stop the aircraft were ineffective, and the captain was convinced that they were going off the end of the runway, he used differential power and rudder to cock the aircraft to the left. The aircraft slid off the end of the runway, went through the US localizer antenna building, struck a dirt blast mound, slid up over the mound, and came to rest with the nose section in the perimeter road between the blast mound and a river levee. Of the 60 passengers and 6 crew members aboard, three passengers and two crew members received minor injuries. The aircraft received substantial damage although no major fire occurred. The passengers and crew evacuated the aircraft without major difficulty.", "probable_cause": "The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was hydroplaning of the landing gear wheels that precluded braking effectiveness."}
