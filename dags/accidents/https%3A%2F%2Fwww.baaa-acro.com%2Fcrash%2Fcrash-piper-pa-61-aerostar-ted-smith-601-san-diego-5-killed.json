During a forced landing on a street, it hit a parked car and a light pole and burst in flames. The pilot, who later expired, said that neither engine developed full power (2575 rpm). He said this was not unusual when power was 1st applied, but said full rpm was generally obtained shortly after the roll was begun. After being committed for takeoff, both rpm's were reportedly between 2,300 and 2,400 rpm. Several witnesses stated the engines sounded like they were running rough. A witness reported the aircraft swerved 'as tho the pilot had difficulty with the left engine.' Reportedly, the pilot 'dropped some more flaps' below the 20\u00b0 takeoff setting 'in order to pull it off' and raised the gear immediately after liftoff. Engine teardowns revealed excessive spark plug gaps, 1 magneto on the right engine had a .008 point gap (.016 required), its #1 and #4 distributor blocks were cracked and the #1 and #6 leads would not fire properly. Hartzell f-6-5a prop governors installed in place of f-6-35a. Aircraft was approximately 348 lbs over max weight limit. All five occupants were killed.
