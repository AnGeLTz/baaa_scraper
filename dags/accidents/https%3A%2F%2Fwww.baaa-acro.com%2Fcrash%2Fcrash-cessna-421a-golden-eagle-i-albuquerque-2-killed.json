The pilot had the aircraft fuel tanks 'topped off' prior to departure from Kansas City. The flight plan indicated 3 hours 30 min enroute to Albuquerque with 5 hours 30 min of fuel on board. Strong enroute winds and turbulence were forecast along the route of flight. The actual flight was 4.4 hrs. The aircraft crashed while turning from base leg to final at the Albuquerque Intl Airport. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of fuel in or around the aircraft. The manufacturer recommends using the main tanks for 90 minutes before switching to any aux tank to prevent venting of return fuel overboard. Vented fuel will diminish fuel supply. Both occupants were killed.
