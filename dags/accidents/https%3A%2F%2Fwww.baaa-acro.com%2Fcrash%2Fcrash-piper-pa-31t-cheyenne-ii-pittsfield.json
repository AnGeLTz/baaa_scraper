He continued his descent to approximately 500 feet above the ground using the vasi (visual approach slope indicator) lights. The pilot stated that he had the airport in sight and' felt well enough in sight to complete landing.' The airplane touched down in approximately 18 inches of snow 60 feet off the right side of the runway. The pilot reported that there was no mechanical malfunction. He said as he got closer to the ground he realized it was snow-mobile tracks and not the runway. He tried to go-around but the airplane impacted the ground collapsing the nose gear. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate inflight decision to continue a landing without runway lights, and his delay in initiating a go-around. A related factor was the pilot's overconfidence in his ability."}
