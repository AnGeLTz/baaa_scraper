Following a normal approach to runway 13, the airplane passed over the threshold when it rolled left and right, causing the right wing struck the runway surface. Out of control, the airplane rolled to the right and crashed in flames. All four crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "An encounter with a trailing vortex generated by a preceding \"heavy\" jet which resulted in an involuntary loss of control of the airplane during final approach. Although cautioned to expect turbulence the crew did not have sufficient information to evaluate accurately the hazard or the possible location of the vortex. Existing FAA procedures for controlling VFR flight did not provide the same protection from a vortex encounter as was provided to flights being given radar vectors in either IFR or VFR conditions."}
