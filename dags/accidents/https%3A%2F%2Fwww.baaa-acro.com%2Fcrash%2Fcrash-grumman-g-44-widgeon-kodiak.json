At mid-runway, he realized that another pilot entered the runway so he pulled on the control column to rotate. The twin engine airplane lifted off but due to an insufficient speed, it stalled and crashed in a lake past the runway end. All seven occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. At the time of the accident, the visibility was very poor due to fog. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot made an evasive maneuver to avoid collision. The following factors were reported:\r\n- Airport conditions: hidden hazard, \r\n- Premature liftoff,\r\n- Failed to obtain flying speed,\r\n- Pilot off other aircraft,\r\n- Vision obstructed by 80 feet rise in elevation at mid-runway, \r\n- Unable to see taxiing aircraft on runway.
