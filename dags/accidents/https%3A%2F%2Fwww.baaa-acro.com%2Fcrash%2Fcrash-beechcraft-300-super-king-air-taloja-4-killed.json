There were four persons on board the aircraft including pilot-in-command. During approach to land at Bombay, contact with ATC was lost after the aircraft had reported its flight level 4,000 feet. The aircraft was found crashed on top of the hills at Taloja village located about 11 NM East of Bombay airports. All the four persons on board received fatal injuries. The aircraft was completely destroyed.", "probable_cause": "The probable cause of accident has been attributed to:\r\n- The commander of the aircraft having meager flying experience on type and limited instrument flying hours encountering instrument meteorological conditions descended below the ATC cleared height of 3,700 feet without intercepting the glide slope.\r\n- The radar controller by not effectively monitoring the aircraft position after he had advised it to intercept the localizer contributed to the cause of the accident.\r\n- The pilot failed to follow procedures, regulations and instructions."}
