The crew interrupted the procedure and was later cleared for a second departure. During this manoeuvre, brakes and tires overheated again. Upon touchdown at Simferopol Airport, a tire located on the right main gear exploded. Debris struck the lower part of the right wing and punctured a fuel tank. Fuel spilled and a fire erupted. The crew was able to stop the plane on the runway and all 65 occupants were evacuated, among them 29 passengers were injured. The aircraft was partially destroyed by fire.
