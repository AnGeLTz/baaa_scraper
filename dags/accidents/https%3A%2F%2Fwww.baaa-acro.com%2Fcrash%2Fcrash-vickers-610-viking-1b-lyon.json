Shortly after takeoff from Bron Airport, while climbing, both engines failed quite simultaneously. The pilot attempted an emergency landing and the aircraft crash landed in a field located near the airport. All 40 occupants were evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The failure of the starboard engine was the consequence of the breaking of a seal in the hydraulic propeller pitch control system. The breakage caused periodic variation of the pitch and hence variations in the speed of the engine. The vibrations of the port engine according to the statement of the crew and experts, were undoubtedly due to an ignition defect. The ignition harness was found to be below requirements."}
