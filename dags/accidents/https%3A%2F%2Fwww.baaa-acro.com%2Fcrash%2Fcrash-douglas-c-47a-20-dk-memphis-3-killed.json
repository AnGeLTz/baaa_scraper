The crew replied 'affirmative,' then the controller cleared the flight to land on any runway. The aircraft began turning left at the end of the runway and continued turning at low altitude until it struck utility poles and crashed thru a warehouse roof about 2 miles from the airport. A witness reported the aircraft was at an altitude of approximately 100 to 150 feet agl, the left propeller was feathered and the right engine was at full power. An exam of the left engine disclosed the #14 cylinder was missing a spark plug from the front spark plug hole. The spark plug lead and 'b' nut were attached to the ignition harness, but no plug was attached to the lead. The spark plug hole and b-nut threads were undamaged. A white deposit was found inside the cylinder spark plug threads and outside the cylinder, adjacent to the hole. The deposit was identified to contain high concentrations of lead and bromine, most likely formed from exhaust gases and fuel during cylinder operation. A company mechanic reportedly worked on the plugs on the previous day. The aircraft was destroyed and all three occupants were killed.
