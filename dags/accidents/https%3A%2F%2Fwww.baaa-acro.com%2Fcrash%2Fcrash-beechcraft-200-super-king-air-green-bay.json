The pilot reported that the right engine lost power as the landing gear was retracting after takeoff. He stated that he elected to land the airplane on the remaining runway and selected gear down. The pilot stated, \"I then flew the aircraft maintaining directional control and landed on runway 24 however due to the short time between selecting gear down and landing the landing gear had not extended and the aircraft landed gear up.\" No anomalies were found with respect to the right engine or fuel controls during the on-scene or follow-up examination.

The airplane came to rest on the runway with approximately 2000 feet of the runway surface remaining.\n", "probable_cause": "The loss of engine power after takeoff for an undetermined reason."}
