Shortly later, the aircraft crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, about 500 km southeast of Saint John's (approximately 46\u00b015 latitude North and 46\u00b031 longitude West). As the airplane failed to arrive in Gander, SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the 39 occupants was found. Weather conditions at the time of the accident were considered as good. \r\nCrew:\r\nD. Nicholls, pilot,\r\nP. E. Walton, copilot,\r\nA. E. Chopping, navigator,\r\nJ. A. Davis, radio officer,\r\nR.

However, it was reported that the flying crew was in duty since 19 hours at the time of the accident, which could be considered as a contributory factor. "}
