The captain decided to land but the remaining distance of 1,100 meters was insufficient. Unable to stop, the aircraft overran and plunged into the bay. All 33 occupants were quickly rescued while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Investigations were able to determine that the speed of the aircraft was correct but that the stall warning light was triggered following an error on the computer that misinterpreted some parameters transmitted by the Pitot tubes. It was reported that the aircraft suffered false stall warnings a couple of times during the past few days."}
