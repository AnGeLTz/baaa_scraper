En route, the pilot was instructed to divert to St Joseph due to the deterioration of the weather conditions en route. The airplane landed in St Joseph at 1905LT and remained there until 2200LT. It took off shortly after 2200LT on the final leg to Omaha. But few minutes after takeoff, the pilot encountered poor weather conditions and limited visibility while cruising at night and heavy rain falls. He reduced his altitude, probably to establish a visual contact with the ground. The plane missed a house by only 50 feet then impacted trees and crashed against an embankment. The wreckage was found about 10 miles northwest of St Joseph. The aircraft was destroyed and all five occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nDon Bontrager. \r\nPassengers:\r\nMrs. Maude Schiffmacher, \r\nFrank Mahan, \r\nW. W. Truelson, \r\nDallas Leitch.
