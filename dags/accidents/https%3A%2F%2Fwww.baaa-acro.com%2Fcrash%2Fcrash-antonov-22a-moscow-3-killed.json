When the fire was detected, the crew decided to divert to Vnukovo Airport (VKO). Electric power was switched from the main system to the emergency one when the aircraft was flying at a height of 3,400 meters some 8 km from VKO. But the emergency system failed also at an altitude of 2,500 meters on approach, leaving the aircraft without any electric power. The crew attempted a emergency belly landing in a field when the aircraft collided with obstacles and a drainage ditch before coming to rest in flames. Three crew members were killed while three others were injured. ", "probable_cause": "Fire in the right main wheel well. "}
