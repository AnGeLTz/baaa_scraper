Pilot feathered the propeller, advised ATC, and was diverting to alternate when left engine quit. He positioned the left engine boost pump to high and low with negative results, but did not feather the propeller. Position of boost pumps, when engines quit, was not determined. Aircraft landed on overpass that was under construction. There was fuel leakage after accident due to aircraft damage. Fuel quantity was sufficient. Examination of aircraft revealed right engine flexible duct from turbocharger to plenum chamber separated due to loose clamp. Hose was installed and club prop installed for each engine run. Both engines operated normally. Induction air hose was pulled during right engine run. Engine ran rough due to excessive rich mixture. No determination could be made for the reason of the left engine power loss. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of power in the right engine due to a disconnected duct between the turbocharger and the plenum chamber. The reason for the loss of power in the left engine was not determined."}
