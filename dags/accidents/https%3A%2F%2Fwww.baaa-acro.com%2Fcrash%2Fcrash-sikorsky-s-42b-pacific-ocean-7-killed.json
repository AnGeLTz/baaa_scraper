One hour after his departure from Pago Pago, in the early hours, the crew encountered technical problems and was forced to dump the fuel. Apparently, an oil leak occurred on the engine n\u00b04 that was shut down. The captain decided to return to Pago Pago but the seaplane named 'Samoan Clipper' crashed into the sea some 120 km south of Pago Pago. Few debris were found floating on water and all seven occupants were killed, among them Captain Edwin C. Musick, first official Captain by Pan Am.\r\nCrew:\r\nEdwin C. Musick, pilot,\r\nCecil G.
