On final approach in poor weather conditions, the pilot in command realized that his position was not correct and decided to make a go around. He increased engine power, retracted the landing gear and deployed the flaps when the aircraft stalled and crashed in a huge explosion few hundred yards from the runway threshold. The aircraft was destroyed and all seven crew members were killed.  ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft stalled because the flaps were deployed in a wrong position. At the time of the stall, the distance between the aircraft and the ground was insufficient to expect a recovery. "}
