While completing the flare, the aircraft was caught by a sudden updraft and landed too far down the runway. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, it overran and came to rest in bushes. All four occupants escaped uninjured and the aircraft was written off. At the time of the accident, weather conditions were considered as fine with overcast at 8,000 feet and good visibility below clouds. The Bambu runway has a gradient of 9,25% and is very short. Here, the pilot should initiate a go-around procedure as a safe landing was not possible in such conditions. ", "probable_cause": null}
