The pilots response was that his aircraft radar showed no build-ups or returns. ATC allowed deviations at pilot's discretion according to the recorded taped conversation. The pilot continued his flight path and was lost on radar shortly thereafter in a descending right turn at 16,800 feet msl. Witnesses saw him exit the bottom of the cloud at about 1,000 feet agl. The wings were seen to separate from the fuselage. Other witnesses saw the fuselage descend inverted, minus the wings, empennage and engines, to impact in a corn field. The wreckage was scattered over an area 1 and 1/2 miles long and 1/2 mile wide. Witnesses who had observed the aircrafts preparations for departure described it as 'mass confusion' in the cockpit. The aircraft reportedly crept forward six times during an extended 10-15 minute checklist while the engines were running at a high rpm setting on a ramp with other aircraft and people around. All four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
