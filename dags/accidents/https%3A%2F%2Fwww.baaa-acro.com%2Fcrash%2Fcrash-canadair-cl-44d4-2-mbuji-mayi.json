The flight engineer elected to extinguish the fire but without success. The aircraft lost height then rolled to the left to an angle of 85\u00b0. The crew extended the flaps to 45\u00b0 to maintain a rate of descent of 700 feet per minute but due to an asymmetric flap condition, the rate of descent increased to 1,500 feet per minute. After the aircraft rolled to the left to an angle of 110\u00b0, at a speed of 98 knots, the captain attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft crash landed in a prairie. All 23 occupants were injured and the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": null}
