Following an uneventful flight from Dakar, the crew started a night approach to Conakry-Gbessia Airport. After touchdown on a wet runway (due to recent rain falls), the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, collided with the ILS antenna and some approach lights, lost its nose gear and came to rest 500 metres further. Ten passengers were injured while all 87 other occupants escaped unhurt. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew, causing the aircraft to land half way down the runway and reducing the landing distance available. The crew failed to follow SOP's and to initiate a go-around procedure as the landing was obviously missed. "}
