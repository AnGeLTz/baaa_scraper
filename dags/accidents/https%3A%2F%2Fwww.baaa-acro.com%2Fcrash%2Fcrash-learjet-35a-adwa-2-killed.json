The aircraft was ferried in South Africa to be refurbished as it was recently purchased by a new owner. Because of the border-crossing prohibition a second flight plan was filed via Djibouti City. While cruising at an altitude of 41,000 feet, the aircraft deviated from the initial route and crossed the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. At 1630LT, the aircraft was shot down by ground fire, entered a dive and crashed near the city of Adwa. Three days of negotiation with the Ethiopian government were necessary to clear a rescue team to visit the crash site. The aircraft was totally destroyed and both pilots, a British and a Swedish citizen, were killed. ", "probable_cause": "According to Ethiopian Authorities, the aircraft was shot down after it penetrated the Ethiopian airspace without valid clearance. At the time of the accident, the area was declared as a non-flying zone and the route was closed to all traffic via a NOTAM. The aircraft was mistaken for an Eritrean fighter aircraft with hostile intention and was therefore shot down by the Ethiopian Defense Force and destroyed."}
