On final approach with one engine voluntarily inoperative, the aircraft stalled at low speed. The crew elected to make a go around but the aircraft hit trees at the end of the runway and crashed. All four occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "The pilot in command was under instruction and was joining the circle to perform the final approach with one engine inoperative. He selected full flaps on final, which is against the procedure published in the AFM that requires a maximum flaps of 25\u00b0. It was also determined that the pilot in command failed to maintain directional control when power was added to attempt a go-around procedure. On his part, the flight instructor failed to take over the control of the aircraft."}
