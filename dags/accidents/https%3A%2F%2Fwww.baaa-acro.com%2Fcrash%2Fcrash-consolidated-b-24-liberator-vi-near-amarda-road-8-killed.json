At approximately 0945LT, the formation, which had been encountering medium to bad weather, approached a heavy bank of cloud. The leader, S/Ldr Heynert, commenced to lose height in an attempt to fly underneath this, but reached the cloud before he was quite low enough and the formation entered the cloud. Number 6 by this time was some little way behind the formation. On entering the cloud visibility was reduced to nil and numbers 2 and 5 in the formation altered course starboard and number 4 altered course port. On coming out of the cloud aircraft number 1 (EW225) and aircraft number 3 (EW247) captained by PO Herbert, were seen to be in close proximity, and number 3 was then seen to pull up and collide with number 1. The tail unit of number 1 was torn off and the aircraft crashed out of control, and one wing (which one not established) of number 3 was torn off, causing the aircraft to crash.\nCrew:\nS/Ldr F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Pierre Andr\u00e9 Heynert, pilot,\nP/O Raymond Maurice Bullen, pilot,\nF/O Robert Stanley Manson, wireless operator and air gunner, \nF/Lt Alexander Norman Borrow, navigator and bomb aimer, \nP/O Lewis Arnold Bridgman, wireless operator and air gunner,\nF/O Peter Ettlinger, flight engineer, \nF/Lt Sydney Wilfred Wells, navigator and bomb aimer, \nF/Sgt Walter Reginald George Wood, air bomber.\nSource: http://www.rquirk.com/amarda/26July45storyV6eb.pdf", "probable_cause": null}
