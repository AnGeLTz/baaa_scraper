Following an uneventful flight, the crew contacted ATC and was cleared to start the descent. At an altitude of 2,400 feet, the right wing struck a rocky peak. On impact, the engine n\u00b04 was torn off. The crew increased engine power and the airplane flew for about 400 meters before it disintegrated in a small valley. The wreckage was found few hours later about 40 km north of Agadir-Inezgane Airport. None of the 188 occupants survived the crash. ", "probable_cause": "The aircraft was descending at a too low altitude and was approaching Agadir-Inezgane Airport on a wrong track, resulting in a controlled flight into terrain. Lack of visibility due to the night and local patches of fog as well as lack of visual references on the ground were considered as contributing factors. "}
