En route, the aircraft went into a low pressure area with thunderstorm activity and turbulence. Shortly later, the right wing broke off at its root, fell away and hit the rudder that was sheared off as well. Out of control, the aircraft dove into the ground and crashed half a mile west of Rock Falls, killing all five crew members.\r\nCrew:\r\n2nd Lt Suren Melkonian,\r\n2nd Lt Leon Andrew Place,\r\nSgt Alfred W. Quinlan,\r\nS/Sgt John E. Quinn,\r\n2nd Lt Robert G.

At the time of the accident, the total weight of the aircraft was in excess of more than one ton, which could be considered as a contributory factor. "}
