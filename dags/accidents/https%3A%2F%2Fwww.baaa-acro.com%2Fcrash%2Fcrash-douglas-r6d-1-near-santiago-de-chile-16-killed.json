While approaching Santiago-Pudahuel Airport, the crew encountered poor weather conditions. Due to limited visibility, the captain decided to initiate a go-around manoeuvre. Few minutes later, while circling for another approach at an altitude of 2,600 feet, the airplane struck a mountain (3,000 feet high) located about 17 km south of the airport. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact and all 16 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": null}
