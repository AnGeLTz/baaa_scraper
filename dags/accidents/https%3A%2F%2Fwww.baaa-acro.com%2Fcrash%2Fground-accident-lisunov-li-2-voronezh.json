In the mean time, the right main gear collapsed and the airplane came to rest in flames ont its belly. All occupants (four crew members and an undetermined number of passengers) evacuated safely while the airplane was partially destroyed by fire and declared as written off.  ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the right main gear rolled on a location of the taxiway that 'housed' three TM-35 anti-tank mines from the Second World War that were buried at an estimated depth of 1, 6 to 1.8 meter. The pressure of the right main landing gear on the earth separating the taxiway surface and the mines triggered the detonator, followed by the explosion of three mines. "}
