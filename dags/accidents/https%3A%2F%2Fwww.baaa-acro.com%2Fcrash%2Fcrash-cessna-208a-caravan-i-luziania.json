Following several approaches, the aircraft was descending to the runway when the instructor reduced the engine power to simulate a failure. From a height of about 300 feet, the aircraft nosed down, lost height and crashed short of runway threshold. All five occupants were uninjured and the aircraft was written off. ", "probable_cause": "The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- The traffic and the high number of landings caused a natural fatigue by the instructor and reduced his appreciations, \r\n- There were too much pilots under training for one single instructor, \r\n- The copilot's experience was insufficient with only one hour on Cessna 208, \r\n- Poor crew coordination, \r\n- Poor crew action on engine power to expect recovery after stall."}
