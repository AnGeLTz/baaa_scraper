Fourteen people were evacuated while 37 others, among them six crew members, were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot failed to take proper action to counteract the loss of speed and height in the final approach turn. The following factors contributed to the accident:\r\n- Lack of operational control by the airlines concerned,\r\n- The pilot in command lacked experience as a transport pilot,\r\n- It is probable that the report from the control tower at Eldorado that the runway was restricted because another aircraft had crashed in the safety zone had a psychological effect on the pilot."}
