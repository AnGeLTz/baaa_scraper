While descending to Pamplona-Noain Airport, the crew encountered marginal weather conditions. Unable to establish a visual contact with runway 15, the crew initiated a go-around procedure. Few minutes later, while flying at an insufficient altitude, the aircraft impacted ground and crashed in a hilly terrain located in the Sierra de Tajonar, near the village of Labiano. The copilot and a passenger were killed while all other occupants were seriously injured. The aircraft was totally destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "The crew did not establish a visual contact with the runway and initiated a go-around procedure during which approximations were noted in the flight techniques adopted by the pilots who continued the flight in unstable conditions. As a result, the aircraft was 16 \u00b0 off the prescribed path and was flying at an insufficient altitude. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- The wind did not correspond to the component reported in the bulletin published for the destination airport, which affected the aircraft flight path,\r\n- The total weight of the airplane was higher than the allowable limit and the CofG was out of permissible limits, reducing the aircraft's performances and its maneuverability,\r\n- The pilots did not have sufficient experience in instrument flight conditions,\r\n- The lack of clear procedures within the operator,\r\n- The lack of supervision from the Spanish Civil Aviation Authority regarding the activities of the operator.
