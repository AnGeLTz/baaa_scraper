On approach, the pilot encountered very bad weather conditions with strong winds and heavy rain falls. The airplane was unstable and landed too far down the runway. After touchdown, it was unable to stop within the remaining distance, overran, struck a fence and eventually came to rest on a road. The pilot was injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. Due to poor weather, all other flights were diverted to other airport.", "probable_cause": null}
