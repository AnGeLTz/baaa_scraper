On final, the pilot-in-command reduced engine power to idle. At a height of 230 feet, as the airspeed dropped below the speed reference, the stick shaker activated. The captain increased engine power when the aircraft lost height and descended until it struck the ground about 400 meters short of runway. The undercarriage were torn off and the airplane slid for few dozen meters before coming to rest. All 110 occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who misjudged speed, distance and altitude on final approach. The crew failed to properly use the Visual Approach Slope Indicators which was considered as a contributing factor.\n"}
