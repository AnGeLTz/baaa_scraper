While cruising in the region of Vehari, the aircraft went out of control, dove into the ground and crashed in a huge explosion, killing all 21 occupants. ", "probable_cause": "The omission of a sealing washer on the carburetor fuel filter of the port engine resulting in fuel leaking on to the ignition systems, culminating in a severe oil fire which finally involved the main port fuel tanks. Secondary causes were a generally low standard of maintenance due to lack of tools, spares, adequate lighting, hurried workmanship, and inexperience in lower staff grades. The crew carried out their duty in a disciplined manner and if disintegration had been delayed for a short while longer an emergency landing could have been made."}
