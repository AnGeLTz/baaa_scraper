He was vectored for an ILS runway 09 approach. While en route, the pilot requested and was given the ILS frequency, minimums for the approach, the airport elevation (491 feet msl), the Newburgh weather and the frequency for the outer compass locator (even tho, current approach charts were on board). He was cleared for the approach, but the aircraft hit trees and crashed, 2.58 miles west of runway 09. Elevation of the crash site was about 580 feet. The minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the approach was 682 feet. An exam of the wreckage revealed no preimpact part malfunction or failure. The pilot was required to wear lenses to correct his vision. The area forecast called for icing, turbulence, low level wind shear, low ceilings, rain, drizzle, fog and a chance of light freezing rain/drizzle. Reportedly the pilot received a full weather briefing, but was not briefed on sigmets Juliett 7 and Lima 4 which called for moderate to severe turbulence and low level wind shear and occasional moderate to severe mixed/clear icing in clouds and precipitations below 8,000 feet.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight encounter with weather\r\nPhase of operation: approach\r\nFindings\r\n1.
