While moving forward and looking out the right window to see a light on the target, the chase pilot lost sight of the lead aircraft. He reduced power and in the process of backing away, the chase aircraft struck the top of the flying tail of the lead acft with its radome jamming the flying tail. The lead aircraft pitched down, lost about 6,000 feet and then recovered. During the emergency landing of the lead aircraft, it pitched over when the gear was extended on short final, struck the ground hard short of the runway, bounced and started porpoising. As the pilot added power for a go-around, the aircraft started to roll. Power was reduced and about 5,000 feet down the runway, the gear collapsed causing the aircraft to veer off the runway. The pilot of the chase aircraft was not military trained and had no formal formation flight training.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: midair collision\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
