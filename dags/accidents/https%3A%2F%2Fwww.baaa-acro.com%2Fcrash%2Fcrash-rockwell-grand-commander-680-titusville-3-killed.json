One witness saw the aircraft flying toward a dark cloud at an unknown altitude, but too high to fly under it. Shortly thereafter, he heard the engine noise increase and decrease, then increase until it was loud. He then heard what sounded like an explosion. He did not see the crash, but saw smoke from the crash site. A woman close to the crash site said the weather was very windy, heavy rain was falling and visibility was restricted. An examination of the wreckage revealed the outboard wing panels had failed from positive overloads and the left horizontal stabilizer had failed downward. These parts were found 3/4 to 1 mile from the main wreckage. Prior to the flight, a passenger, who paid for fuel and minor maintenance, said the purpose of the flight was for surveying. However, no surveying equipment was on board. Sheriff personnel said the aircraft was under surveillance for an illegal operation.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight encounter with weather\r\nPhase of operation: cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
