It took off from Pollen\u00e7a around noon. At 1430LT, while cruising over the Mediterranean Sea, the radio operator reported his position and informed ground he was encountering very bad weather conditions with storms. This was the last transmission received from the crew. As the airplane failed to arrive in Alghero, SAR operations were initiated but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the 14 occupants was ever found.", "probable_cause": null}
