On approach, while descending to a height of 7,000 feet, the crew got a n\u00b02 prop low oil warning. The engine was shut down but the crew was unable to feather the propeller for unknown reason. Despite the situation, the pilot-in-command was able to continue the approach and landed safely on runway 32. After touchdown, the n\u00b02 prop separated from its mount and debris punctured the n\u00b01 fuel tank. The airplane caught fire and came to rest in flames after a course of 4,000 feet. All three crew members escaped uninjured while the aircraft was partially destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of a powerplant and propeller system on approach.
