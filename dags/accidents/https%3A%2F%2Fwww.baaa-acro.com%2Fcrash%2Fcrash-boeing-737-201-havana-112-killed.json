It rolled to the right then descended until it struck power cables and a railway track before it disintegrated in a field located less than one km east from the airport. Three female passengers were seriously injured while 110 other occupants were killed, among them 102 Cubans, 6 Mexicans (crew) and 2 Argentinians. Three days after the accident, one of the three survivors died from her injuries. A second survivor died one week later, on May 25. The aircraft was operated by Cubana de Aviac\u00edon under a wet lease contract from the Mexican operator Global Air (Damojh A\u00e9reol\u00edneas), and the service was operated under callsign DMJ972. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control of the aircraft during initial climb following a chain of human errors in the preparation of the flight and the weight and balance calculation. It was determined that the crew calculated the CofG to be 17,4% while it was actually 28,5%, about 0,5% below the rear limit of 29%. Consequently, the horizontal stabilizer trim was set at 5 3/4 units instead of 3 1/4 units. This caused the aircraft to enter an excessive nose up attitude immediately after liftoff. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Inconsistencies in crew training,\r\n- Errors in weight and balance calculations,\r\n- Low operational standards manifested in flight."}
