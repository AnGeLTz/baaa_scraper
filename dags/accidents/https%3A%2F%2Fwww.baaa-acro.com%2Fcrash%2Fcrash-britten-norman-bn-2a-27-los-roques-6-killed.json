During initial climb, the crew was cleared to climb to 6,500 feet. Seven minutes later, the crew informed ATC he was climbing to 5,000 feet and reported his position some 10 NM from Gran Roque VOR. While cruising at 5,400 feet at a speed of 120 knots, the aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in the sea. SAR operations did not find any trace of the aircraft nor the six occupants and all operations were abandoned after one week. The Italian couturier Vittorio Missoni was among the passenger. In June 2013, some debris were localized at a depth of 75 meters and five bodies were found on 17OCT2013. Eventually, the wreckage was recovered on 25NOV2013.", "probable_cause": null}
