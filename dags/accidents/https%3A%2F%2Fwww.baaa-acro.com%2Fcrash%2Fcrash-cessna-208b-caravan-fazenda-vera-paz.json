After touchdown on runway 32, the pilot lost control of the aircraft that veered off runway to the left and came to rest in a drainage ditch, bursting into flames. The pilot escaped uninjured while the aircraft was destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control on landing for unknown reasons. It was not possible to determine whether the heavy rainfall that occurred in the region effectively contributed to the loss of control of the aircraft on the ground. In addition to the narrowing of the runway, the position of the drainage ditch became an obstacle, which prevented the aircraft from decelerating safely, culminating in the collision of the front landing gear against it and the impact of the propeller on the ground."}
