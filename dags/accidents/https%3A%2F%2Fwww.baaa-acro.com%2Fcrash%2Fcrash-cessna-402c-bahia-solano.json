During the takeoff roll on runway 36, the airplane deviated to the right and veered off runway. While contacting soft ground, the right main gear collapsed. The aircraft rotated and came to rest in a grassy area about 5 metres to the right of the runway. All 9 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "A loss of control during the takeoff roll as a result of inappropriate techniques on the part of the pilot-in-command who suffered a loss of situational awareness by not detecting the deviation in a timely manner. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified: \r\n- Inadequate crew decisions to apply appropriate corrective actions,\r\n- Inadequate crew training program, \r\n- Poor operational supervision on part of the operator."}
