The aircraft was crewed by two pilots and, so far as could be determined, its take-off weight was between 8,320 and 8,600 lb. The maximum permitted take-off weight was 8,400 lb. ATC clearance for an IFR departure was obtained before the aircraft taxied from the business aviation apron for take-off from runway 23, with a take-off run available of 2,658 metres. According to survivors, the take-off proceeded normally until shortly after the aircraft became airborne when they heard a thud or bang. The aircraft was then seen by external witnesses at low height, to the left of the extended runway centerline, in a wings level attitude that later developed into a right bank and a gentle descent. Witnesses reported hearing an engine spluttering and saw at least one propeller rotating slowly. There was a brief 'emergency' radio transmission from the commander and the aircraft was seen entering a steep right turn. It then entered a dive. A witness saw the wings levelled just before the aircraft struck the ground on a northerly track. Three survivors were helped from the wreckage by a nearby farm worker before flames from a severe post-impact fire engulfed the cabin. ", "probable_cause": "The following causal factors were identified:\r\n- The left engine suffered a catastrophic failure of its accessory gear train leading to a progressive but complete loss of power from that engine,\r\n- The propeller of the failed engine was not feathered and therefore the aircraft was incapable of climbing on the power of one engine alone, \r\n- The commander feathered the propeller of the right-hand engine, which was mechanically capable of producing power resulting in a total loss of thrust, \r\n- The commander attempted to return to the departure airfield but lost control of the aircraft during a turn to the right.
