The aircraft encountered snow and ice about 4 hours north of Wick on the return leg, and these persisted for the remainder of the flight. When the aircraft approached Wick at about 2000LT, the weather was atrocious, low cloud, frequent showers and a strong gusty wind. The aircraft was heard over the airfield and given a course to fly, but contact was then lost. At 2040LT, the Fortress flew into a gently sloping hill, probably Cnocan Ruar, at an altitude of 700 feet. Six crew members were killed while three others were injured.\r\nCrew (519th Squadron):\r\nF/Lt F. K. Humphries, pilot,\r\nF/O G. H. Pullan, pilot,\r\nF/O T. G.

This ignores the fact the MAO would not have been able to provide a QFE (it should have been requested it from ATC, or ATC should have offered it voluntarily) especially in the poor conditions, but neither course of action was taken."}
