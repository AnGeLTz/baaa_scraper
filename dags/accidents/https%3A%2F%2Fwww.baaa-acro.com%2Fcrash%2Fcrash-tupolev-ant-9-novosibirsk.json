The pilot decided to attempt an emergency landing and reduced his altitude. At a height of about 200 metres, the mechanic made a mistake, positioning the elevator in a wrong angle. This caused the aircraft to nose up, to stall and eventually to crash. All occupants evacuated with minor injuries and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the left engine overheated because of a loss of water in the cooling system, this following the loss of the collector's cap. This resulted in a stall at low altitude due to the fact that the aircraft's speed was insufficient. "}
