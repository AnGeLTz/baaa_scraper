The aircraft named Loina was destroyed and all five occupants were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nNorman Evans, pilot,\r\nMaxwell Brown, copilot,\r\nEdward Best, flight engineer. \r\nPassengers:\r\nG. S. Anderson, \r\nG. Garlick.\n", "probable_cause": "It was determined that VH-URT had gone into an uncontrollable spin, and three possible precipitating factors were: a loss of control after a power plant failure, the fouling of the tail surfaces while the trailing aerial was being reeled in or a structural failure. There was also evidence of a small fire in the rear of its cabin, which may have occurred before the crash, but this probably did not factor in the accident. And in view of two fatal accidents and other difficulties with the type, Australia would subsequently suspend the certificate of airworthiness of the De Havilland 86."}
