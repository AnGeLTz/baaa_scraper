The aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a wooded area located about one km from Cherkessk. The aircraft was totally destroyed upon impact and all 50 occupants were killed. The tail was found about 1,600 metres from the main wreckage.

Violation of the requirements of the current documents when extending the overhaul life for the An-24 RA 46516 aircraft and extending the established overhaul life without taking into account its long-term operation in a humid and hot climate;\r\n3. Inconsistency of the regulatory documents governing the organization of work to establish and extend the resources and service life of civil aircraft (Regulation 1994) with the requirements of flight safety in modern conditions;\r\n4. Violation of the requirements of the technology for repairing aircraft and household equipment during repairs in ARZ conditions;\r\n5. Imperfection of technological documentation for periodic maintenance in terms of determining the corrosion and corrosion-fatigue state of the aircraft structure in hard-to-reach areas;\r\n6.
