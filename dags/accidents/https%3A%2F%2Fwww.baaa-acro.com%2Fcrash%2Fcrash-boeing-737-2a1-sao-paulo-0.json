The aircraft landed at a speed of 185 knots with flaps down to 15\u00b0 on wet runway 09L. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, lost its undercarriage and came to rest 200 metres further. All 128 occupants were evacuated safely, among them two passengers were slightly injured. The aircraft was written off. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the n\u00b03 leading edge flap actuator attachment fitting on the wing front spar had fractured due to corrosion. The actuator came away and caused the failure of some hydraulic lines and damage to the thrust control cables. Some 1981 Boeing Service Bulletins had not been complied with. One of these included the replacement of the aluminium leading edge flap actuator attachment fitting with a steel one; this had not been done. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Excessive workload on approach and landing due to the emergency situation,\r\n- Poor approach planning, \r\n- Lack of visibility due to the night,\r\n- Poor crew coordination, \r\n- Poor crew resources management, \r\n- The crew forgot to lower the flaps electrically on approach, causing the speed to be 32 knots in excess, \r\n- Poor aircraft maintenance and supervision,\r\n- Failures in the supervision of the Company's operating sector.
