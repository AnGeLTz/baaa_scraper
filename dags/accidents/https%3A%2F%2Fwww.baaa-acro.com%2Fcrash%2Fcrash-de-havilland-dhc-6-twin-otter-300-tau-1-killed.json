The cable that separated failed from corrosion. No evidence of fatigue cracking or mechanical wear was found. Corrosion products were found within 2 inches of the serapation on both cable pieces.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: airframe/component/system failure/malfunction\r\nPhase of operation: approach - vfr pattern - base leg/base to final\r\nFindings\r\n1.
