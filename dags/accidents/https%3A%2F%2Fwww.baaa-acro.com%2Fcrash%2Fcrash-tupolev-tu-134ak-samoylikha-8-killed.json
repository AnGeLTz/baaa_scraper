While cruising at an altitude of 3,000 metres parallel to a Tupolev TU-22M3, both crews agreed to close each other about 10-15 metres when the TU-22 struck the tail of the TU-134. While the crew of the TU-22 was able to return to Moscow-Zhukovsky Airport for an emergency landing, the TU-134 entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a wooded area located in Samoylikha, about 140 km southeast of Moscow. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all eight occupants were killed.
