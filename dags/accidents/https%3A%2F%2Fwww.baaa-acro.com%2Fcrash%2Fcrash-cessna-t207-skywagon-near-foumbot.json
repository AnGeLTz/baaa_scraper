En route, he encountered fuel/engine problems and elected to divert to the Foumban Airport which is located about 20 km northeast of Foumbot. By night, the single engine airplane struck trees and crashed in a wooded and hilly terrain. The pilot was injured and the aircraft was destroyed. It is believed that fuel leaked from the tank after a fuel cap has been damaged during a previous stop at Tamanrasset Airport. Also, the pilot was not experienced in flight operations in Africa.
