At 2053, Dixie 06 reported a 4 mile final for a low approach to the local controller. At 2054:19, the local controller cleared ABX74, N19T, '...taxi position and hold five.' ABX74 was awaiting takeoff instructions on runway 05 when the collision occurred. Investigation revealed the local controller forgot ABX74. She became preoccupied with other traffic using runway 36. The local controller termed the traffic as busier than normal for a night operation. At the time of the accident, the tower was staffed with two air traffic controllers and an air traffic assistant. No supervisor or coordinator was available in the cab to detect controller overload and offer assistance. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. The military aircraft involved in the collision was a USAF Douglas RF-4C Phantom II registered 64-1032 with two pilots on board. They escaped uninjured.
