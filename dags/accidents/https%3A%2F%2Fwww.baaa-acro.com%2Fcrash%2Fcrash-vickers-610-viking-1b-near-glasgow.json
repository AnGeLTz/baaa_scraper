At 1946LT, while cruising at an altitude of 4,700 feet, the captain contacted ATC to obtain the permission to descend to Renfrew. Few minutes later, he requested if the outer marker was operative. Shortly later, the aircraft hit the slope of Mt Irish Law and crashed. All 20 occupants were quickly rescued, two of them were slightly injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Poor judgement on part of the captain who continued the approach at a too low altitude to maintain a safe distance with the ground. The failure to receive the outer marker beacon signal was considered as a contributory factor, as well as the low visibility caused by marginal weather conditions. "}
