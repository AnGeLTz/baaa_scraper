Investigation revealed that approximately 3 to 5 inches of snow had fallen at the airport during the day and the snow had not been removed from the runway that evening. A witness reported there was 5 inches of snow on the runway and it was snowing at the time of the accident. The pilot reported that 'shortly after takeoff the aircraft yawed, then veered right. Upon correcting this condition left wing struck the ground.' When the right engine was tested a small leak was discovered at the air intake manifold. The left engine was severely damaged by fire and could not be tested. All four occupants escaped uninjured.
