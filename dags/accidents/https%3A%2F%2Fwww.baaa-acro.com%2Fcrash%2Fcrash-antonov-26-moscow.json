After takeoff, the crew encountered strong headwinds then the visibility dropped due to snow falls and low clouds. In such conditions, a direct approach was refused to the crew who should differ the landing procedure. Few minutes later, both engines failed due to fuel exhaustion. The crew completed a belly landing in an open field located about 3 km from Bykovo Airport. All five crew members escaped with minor injuries while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
