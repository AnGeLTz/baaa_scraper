P. Donovan, a West Coast drugstore chain owner and a gemstone dealer who carried a satchel of diamonds. An hour into scud-running beneath low-lying clouds, Donaldson heard booming noises and discovered that he was scraping treetops. There was no time to recover. The 40C dove forward \u201cas if it had been a giant scythe,\u201d reported the Roseburg, Oregon News-Review. \u201cOne tree, nearly a foot in diameter was cut off about 25 feet from the ground.\u201d Donaldson rushed out of the cockpit as the biplane\u2019s nitrate-doped cotton skin fueled a fire so intense it melted the aircraft\u2019s metal propeller. He fought through the flames to check on his passenger, but saw that Donovan had been killed on impact. Donaldson\u2019s actions left him with severe burns; for the rest of his life he would have a scar tissue circumscription of flight goggles on his face. Bloody and incoherent, Donaldson staggered down to a highway, where a preacher and his family hurriedly drove him to a pharmacy nine miles north, in Canyonville. \u201cThe next day the airline went up there and they got the remains of poor Donovan,\u201d says Pemberton. \u201cThey picked out what diamonds they could, and they salvaged what they could of the engine.\u201d For years afterward, townspeople hiked up to the crash site to sift for diamonds. (Rumors abound of Canyonville wives who own rings set with diamonds from the crash.) In 1929, they hacksawed the tail section off to use as a nursery school jungle gym.\r\nSource: www.airspacemag.com", "probable_cause": "Pilot error. "}
