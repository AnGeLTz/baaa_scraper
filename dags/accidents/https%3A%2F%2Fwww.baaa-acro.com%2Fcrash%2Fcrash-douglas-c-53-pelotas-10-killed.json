During the takeoff roll, the airplane deviated to the right. The pilot-in-command elected to regain control but due to over-correction, the airplane turned sharply to the left, swung on runway and eventually veered off runway to the left before colliding with two parked DC-3 (registered PP-ABZ and PP-HDJ). A fire erupted and all three aircraft were destroyed by fire. While both other aircraft were empty at the time of the accident, both pilots and eight passengers were killed, the other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was attributed to pilots error - incorrect use of the brakes and control while on the ground. Wrong takeoff configuration on part of the flying crew. "}
