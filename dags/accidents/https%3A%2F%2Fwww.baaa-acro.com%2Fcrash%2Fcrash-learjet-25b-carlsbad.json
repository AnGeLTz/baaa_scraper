They said the airplane touched down about 1,500 feet from the approach end of the 4,700 feet long runway. The pilot said he applied the brakes but could not stop the airplane on the runway. The airplane departed the end of the runway and continued forward over rough and uneven terrain. The main landing gear sheared off and penetrated both wings. The airplane came to a stop in a gully. Other witnesses located on the ground and in the air traffic control tower reported the airplane was 'high and fast' and touched down at about midfield or after.", "probable_cause": "The pilot not attaining the proper touchdown point because of excessive altitude and airspeed, and the pilot's failure to perform a go-around.
