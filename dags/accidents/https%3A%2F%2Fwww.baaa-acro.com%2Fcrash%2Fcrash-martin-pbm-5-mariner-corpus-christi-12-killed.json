This second aircraft was approaching Corpus Christi NAS to land when the collision occurred. Both aircraft went out of control and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico, some 2,5 miles offshore. On the first Mariner, there were no survivor among the 12 occupants. On board the second Mariner, five crew members were rescued while all ten other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The collision was attributed to a lack of discipline and coordination on part of both crew who failed to follow the procedures in place around the Corpus Christi NAS. At the time of the accident, there was no navigation aids and no ATC at the airbase and both crew were trained aware to put full attention to potential traffic. At the time of the collision, both crew were not focused on workload and environmental operations. Although it was dark at the time of the accident, visibility was greater than nine miles and weather conditions were considered as good."}
