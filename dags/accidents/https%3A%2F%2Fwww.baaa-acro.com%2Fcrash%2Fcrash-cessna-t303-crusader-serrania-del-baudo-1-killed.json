Two minutes after takeoff, the pilot informed ATC he was flying at an altitude of 1,500 feet and estimated his ETA at Quibd\u00f3-El Cara\u00f1o Airport at 1315LT. Nine minutes into the flight, while cruising in IMC conditions, the aircraft contacted trees and crashed in a dense wooded area located near Serran\u00eda del Baud\u00f3, some 50 km north of Nuqu\u00ed. SAR operations were initiated but the wreckage was found five days later only. Both passengers, a female aged 18 and her baby aged 8 months were evacuated with minor injuries while the pilot was killed. The aircraft was totally destroyed by impact forces. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain following the decision of the pilot to continue under VFR mode in IMC conditions. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Poor risk assessment when planning a flight in VFR conditions over a mountainous area, even though the weather conditions were unfavorable.\r\n- Loss of situational awareness after entering the mountain area under VFR mode in IMC conditions, resulting in a CFIT.
