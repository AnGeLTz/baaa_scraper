The captain decided to takeoff and instructed the copilot to raise the landing immediately after rotation. In a certain confusion, the copilot raised the landing gear while the aircraft was still rolling on the runway. It sank on its belly and slid for several yards before coming to rest. There were no casualties but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that an incorrect use of brakes and/or flying controls after touchdown caused the aircraft to deviate from the centerline. Poor crew coordination and a premature retraction of the landing gear were considered as contributing factors. "}
