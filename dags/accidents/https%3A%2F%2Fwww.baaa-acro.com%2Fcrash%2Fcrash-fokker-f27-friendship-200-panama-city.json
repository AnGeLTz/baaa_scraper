It landed back on the runway about 380 metres from the runway end. It slid on all this distance, overran then turned to the left and came to rest in a grassy area about 60 metres past the runway end. All 13 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "The stall that occurred during the initial climb was the result of the copilot's confusion in interpreting the information transmitted by the captain which led him to initiate the rotation before reaching the speed of 95 knots (V1). The crew could not obtain sufficient power from both engines because they had not activated the methanol water system in view of the existing meteorological conditions, the wet runway and the takeoff weight, which remains a contributing factor."}
