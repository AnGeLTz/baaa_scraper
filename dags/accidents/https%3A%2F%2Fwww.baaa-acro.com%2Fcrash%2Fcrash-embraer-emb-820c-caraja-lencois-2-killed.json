On final approach to Len\u00e7\u00f3is Airport, the crew encountered limited visibility due to marginal weather conditions. The captain decided to continue the approach and completed a turn to the left when the aircraft crashed 2 km from the runway threshold, bursting into flames. The aircraft was totally destroyed and both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The decision of the captain to continue the approach under VFR mode in IMC conditions to an airport that was not suitable for IFR operations. The following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- The lack of ground references may have contributed to the commander's spatial disorientation,\r\n- Although the weather conditions made it impossible to land under VFR conditions, the captain insisted on landing, neglecting IFR procedures,\r\n- The captain ignored the copilot's advice and continued with the approach procedure,\r\n- The captain put the aircraft in an attitude that caused it to stall,\r\n- Poor judgment on part of the captain,\r\n- Despite the implementation of a CRM program, the operator was unable to identify that the captain was violating the published procedures."}
