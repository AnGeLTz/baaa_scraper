The pilot reported turbulences, but demurred descending to a lower altitude despite a pirep of clear weather below. He then reported 'in a cell' with turbulences. Radar and radio contact with the aircraft were lost. Another pilot, who flew approximately 15 miles further south, reported no weather, but said there was extreme weather to the north with near constant lightning. Subsequently, N340MV impacted the ground in a steep nose-down, left wing low attitude, after a 14,000 feet descent. The landing gear was extended when the plane crashed. An exam of the wreckage revealed no preimpact structural failure or aircraft component malfunction. Also, the wreckage showed no evidence of weather damage from hail or lightning. However, weather info showed there was high altitude thunderstorm activity with turbulences in the area at the time of the mishap. Both occupants were killed.
