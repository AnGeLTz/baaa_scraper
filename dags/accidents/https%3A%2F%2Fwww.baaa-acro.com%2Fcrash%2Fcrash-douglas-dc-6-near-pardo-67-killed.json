While cruising at an altitude of 4,800 meters, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with a low pressure area and severe turbulences. The airplane went out of control, entered a dive, partially disintegrated and eventually crashed in a field located 12 km west of Pardo. All 67 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The aircraft disintegrated in flight due to rupture of the right wing following the application of loads in excess of the design loads, in a zone of extremely violent turbulence. A contributing factor was insufficient evaluation of the forecast, by both the aircraft captain and by the airline dispatcher, which resulted in the choice of an inappropriate flight altitude."}
