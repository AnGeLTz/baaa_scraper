All nine occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of a poor flight preparation on part of the crew who took wrong decisions as well as airport authorities. The following findings were reported: \r\n- The runway was contaminated with wet snow and whose thickness exceeded the permissible limit,\r\n- The crew decided to takeoff with a tailwind of 21 km/h, which made the runway distance insufficient given the flight conditions,\r\n- The runway was not properly cleared of snow, \r\n- The crew failed to abandon the takeoff procedure in a timely manner.
