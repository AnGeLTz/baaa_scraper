According to the pilot, the last thing he remembers during the flight is bracketing the loc and reading 1,600 feet on the altimeter. Subsequently, the pilot further stated, he remembers being on the ground inside the wreckage, mitigating the injuries suffered and trying to stay warm. A post-accident invest revealed that the aircraft was to the left of the localizer course when it struck two trees 12 feet agl (1,062 feet msl), while in a 30\u00b0 right bank. The aircraft made a flat 360 right pirouette over some small trees, tearing off the left wing before impacting the ground and sliding approximately 600 feet. A post-crash fire erupted from the right wing tank but it extinguished itself. A dot FAA operational flight test found the localizer to be within limits. A leak check of the aircraft static system and a bench check of both altimeters were satisfactory.
