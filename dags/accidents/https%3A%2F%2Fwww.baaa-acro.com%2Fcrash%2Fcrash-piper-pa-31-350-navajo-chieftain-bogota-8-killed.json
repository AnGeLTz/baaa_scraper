The copilot contacted ATC and declared an emergency following technical problems. The crew was immediately cleared to land at his discretion when the aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a prairie located 600 metres from the runway 28 threshold. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all eight occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "A possible fuel contamination affected the power on one engine or both. The aircraft was overloaded at takeoff, which, compounded by the considerable loss of power to the engines due to the altitude of the aerodrome, did not allow the pilot to maneuver the aircraft to return to the runway. In addition, the center of gravity, despite being within the permissible limits, was too far behind for an operation in adverse weather conditions."}
