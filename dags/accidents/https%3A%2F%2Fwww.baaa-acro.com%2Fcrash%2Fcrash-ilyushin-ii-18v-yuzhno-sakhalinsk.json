On short final, the captain realized he was well above the glide so he decided to increase the rate of descent. The airplane struck the runway surface nose first at a speed of 230 km/h and with a positive acceleration of 2,8 g. It bounced then landed a second time with an acceleration of 3,8 g. Upon impact, the nose gear was torn off, the engine number one detached and both wings were bent. Out of control, the airplane slid for several yards before coming to rest. All occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the pilot-in-command. Poor crew coordination and poor weather conditions were considered as contributing factors. "}
