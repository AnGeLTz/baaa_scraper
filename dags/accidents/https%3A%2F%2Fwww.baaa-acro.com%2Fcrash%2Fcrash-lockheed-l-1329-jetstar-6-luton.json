It then overran the end of the runway, became airborne over a 10 metre deep escarpment, struck the ground and caught fire. The seven passengers escaped from the aircraft through a hole in the fuselage and the commander exited through his direct vision (DV) window; all of them sustained relatively minor injuries. The co-pilot received severe spinal injuries and was unable to vacate the cockpit without the assistance of the rescue services. The external and cabin fires were extinguished by the aerodrome fire service who were then delayed in entering the cabin by the concentration of smoke and the lack of breathing apparatus. ", "probable_cause": "It was concluded that the accident was caused by the commander's action in attempting a landing from a non-precision approach without sufficient visual reference."}
