En route, while cruising at an altitude of 35,000 feet, the crew encountered technical problems with the primary hydraulic system. He contacted ATC and was cleared to divert to Campinas-Viracopos Airport for an emergency landing. On approach, the crew was unable to lower the undercarriage that remained blocked in their wheel well. The crew elected to lower the gear manually and several troubleshootings were unsuccessful. The decision was taken to complete a belly landing on runway 33. After touchdown, the aircraft slid for few dozen metres and eventually came to rest. All 38 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. It was later transferred to the TAM Museum. ", "probable_cause": "A loss of hydraulic fluids occurred on a hose separating a fitting from a pump on the right engine, causing the malfunction of the primary hydraulic system and resulting in the degradation of the mechanical system of the landing gear control command."}
