He completed an emergency landing in an open field located near Jennerstown, Pennsylvania. The aircraft passed the night in the field and on Saturday morning 20DEC1930, the pilot started all three engines to re-position the aircraft to its base. Shortly after takeoff from the field, at a height of about 10 feet, the right engine failed. The pilot elected to gain height but due to an insufficient speed, the aircraft did not get enough altitude and impacted trees with its right wing. The airplane stalled and crashed on the ground. The pilot evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Engine failure after liftoff."}
