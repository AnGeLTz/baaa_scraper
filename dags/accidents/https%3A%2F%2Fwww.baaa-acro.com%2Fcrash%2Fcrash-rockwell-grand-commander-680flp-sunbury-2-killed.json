He was briefed on conditions of low ceilings, fog, light rain, drizzle, snow and blowing snow along his route. However, he did not ask about icing conditions and the briefing did not include a fight precaution for icing nor a sigmet (issued at 0820 est) which forecasted moderate to severe mixed icing. While en route, the pilot made several altitude changes by request. When he was queried about a heading deviation, he replied 'we're having a little problem.' this was the last radio contact. ATC received no radio calls concerning icing problems or an emergency. Witnesses near the crash site saw the aircraft come out of the clouds in a near vertical descent, rotating in a nose down attitude, then impact and burn. Airframe ice up to 1/2 inch thick was found on/near parts that were not fire damaged.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight encounter with weather\r\nPhase of operation: cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
