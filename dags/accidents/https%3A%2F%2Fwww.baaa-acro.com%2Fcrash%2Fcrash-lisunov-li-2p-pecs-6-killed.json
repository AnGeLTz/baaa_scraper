At this time, the weather at destination was as follow: horizontal visibility 4 km with a ceiling at 320 meters. Upon arrival, these conditions worsened and the ceiling dropped to 240 meters. At 1028LT, the pilot started a visual approach and while at a height of 150 meters, he told ATC he did not need the ground transmitter that was switched off. Three minutes later, as he was unable to locate the runway, he started a go around and made a turn to the right. Shortly later, while flying in clouds, the airplane hit trees and crashed in a wooded area located on Mt Jakab, few km from the airport. A crew member was seriously injured while six other occupants were killed. \r\nSource & photos: http://www.li-2.hu/", "probable_cause": "After he started the go around maneuver, it was reported that the pilot in command made a turn to the right which was against the published procedures that specified a turn to the left.
