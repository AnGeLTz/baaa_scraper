The crew shut down the engine, feathered the propeller and decided to return to Krasnoyarsk for a safe landing. On final approach, the speed was too high and the crew encountered problems to lower the undercarriage so the captain elected to make a go around. Few minutes later, during a second attempt to land, while at a height of some 50 meters, the aircraft stalled and crashed few hundred yards short of the runway threshold. Eighteen occupants were injured while seven others, among them four crew members, were killed. ", "probable_cause": null}
