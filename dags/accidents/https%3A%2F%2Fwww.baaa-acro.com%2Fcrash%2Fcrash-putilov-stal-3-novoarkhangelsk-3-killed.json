The airplane entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a pasture. All three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the crash was an insufficient structural strength of the upper core of the fuselage frame n\u00b03, which caused the frame to collapse under the conditions of flight in a pre-thunderstorm front and the subsequent collapse of the entire aircraft.\r\nThe following factors were identified:\r\n- Insufficient strength of some elements of the airplane according to the conditions set by the strength standards of 1937,\r\n- Failure of the design bureau of Plant n\u00b081, which allowed the frame n\u00b03 of the fuselage to have insufficient strength,\r\n- Failure of the weather station at Kiev Airport, which did not indicate thunderstorm phenomena in the weather forecast for the Kiev - Odessa route, as it was according to the weather service sector in reality."}
