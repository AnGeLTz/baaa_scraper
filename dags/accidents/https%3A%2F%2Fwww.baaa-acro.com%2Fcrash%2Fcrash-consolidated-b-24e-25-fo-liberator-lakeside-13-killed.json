While cruising at an altitude of 11,100 feet, the Liberator registered 42-7183 that was in the third position was left behind so its captain increased power to regain its position in the formation. Doing so, the tail of the 42-7183 hit the left wing of the 42-7408. On impact, the number one engine of 42-7408 was sheared off and both aircraft went out of control, dove into the ground and crashed in a huge explosion.

However, investigators point out that the massive presence of ice in the region remains a contributing factor to the accident in the sense that aircraft performances were reduced."}
