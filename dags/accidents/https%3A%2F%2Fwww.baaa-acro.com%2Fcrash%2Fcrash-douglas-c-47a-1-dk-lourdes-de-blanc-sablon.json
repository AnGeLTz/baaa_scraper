The aircraft deviated 10\u00b0 or 15\u00b0 to the left without the crew being aware that this deviation had occurred and, after rolling for about 750 ft, it left the north side of the runway. The attempt to take off was continued. However, adequate speed could not be obtained. After a series of impacts, the aircraft came to rest about 3,150 feet from the start of takeoff and about 700 feet short of the base of a sharply rising hill.

It was operated on behalf of the D\u00e9partement des Transports et des Communications du Qu\u00e9bec.", "probable_cause": "Loss of directional control during takeoff at night from an unlighted aerodrome."}
