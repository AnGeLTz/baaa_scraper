While cruising vertical to Mont\u00e9limar, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with thunderstorm activity and turbulences. Control was lost and the airplane entered a dive before crashing on a hill located near Saint-Vincent-de-Barr\u00e8s, about 12 km northwest of Mont\u00e9limar. Debris were found on a wide area and all eight occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the loss of control was the consequence of in-flight turbulences while cruising in a thunderstorm area. The assumption that the aircraft may have been struck by lightning was not ruled out. Severe turbulences also may cause the aircraft to suffer a structural failure. "}
