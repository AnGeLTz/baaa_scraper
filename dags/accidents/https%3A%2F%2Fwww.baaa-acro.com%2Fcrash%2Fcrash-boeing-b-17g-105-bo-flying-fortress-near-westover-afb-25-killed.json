While descending to Westover, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with low clouds and thunderstorm activity, and turn about two hours over the area for improvement. On final approach, while flying at a height of 800 feet, the aircraft hit the slope of Mt Tom (1,000 feet high) located about 8 miles northwest of the airport. The aircraft crashed about 180 feet from the summit and was totally destroyed, killing all 25 occupants. \r\nCrew:\r\nF/O Herman J. Valdrini Jr.,\r\nCpt Henry A. Lebrecht, \r\n1Lt Wayne L.
