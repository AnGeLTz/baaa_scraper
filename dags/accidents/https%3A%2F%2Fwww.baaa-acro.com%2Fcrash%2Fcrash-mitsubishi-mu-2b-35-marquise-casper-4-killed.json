Subsequently, it collided with the top of a ridge, along the localizer centerline, before reaching the outer marker, about 8 miles from the airport. Elevation of the crash site was about 5,800 feet; minimum descent altitude before intercepting the ILS glide slope was 7,100 feet; crossing altitude at the outer marker was 6,700 feet.
