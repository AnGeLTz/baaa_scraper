The crew continued the takeoff procedure and the flight to Manaus. After two hours and burning fuel, the aircraft landed at Manaus-Eduardo Gomes Airport. Upon touchdown, the right main gear collapsed and the aircraft veered to the right and came to rest. All 49 occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Collision with a tapir during takeoff, causing severe damages to the right main gear.\r\nThe following findings were identified:\r\n- The lack of isolation of the operational area allowed the land animal to enter the runway for landings and takeoffs, contributing to the accident.\r\n- The crew did not notice the presence of the land animal on the runway early enough to abort the takeoff without extrapolating the runway limits and avoiding collision.\r\n- The presence of the land animal (Tapirus terrestris) interfered with the operation and led to the collision of the right main landing gear."}
