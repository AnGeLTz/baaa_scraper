En route, weather conditions deteriorated and the visibility was limited due to low clouds. The crew reduced his altitude to 65 metres to maintain a visual contact with the ground. When facing trees, the pilot-in-command elected to gain height. At a speed of 115 km/h, the aircraft contacted tree tops and crashed in a wooded and hilly terrain. All five occupants were uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "The crew continued the flight at an unsafe altitude until the aircraft contacted trees and crashed.
