He force landed the aircraft in a wooded area when he could not make an open field. A post accident inspection of the engine revealed that the fuel control unit arm was loose, and the lock wire was not in place. The arm was positioned so that a maximum power demand from the throttle would correspond to an idle power demand at the fuel control.

The inspection checklist called for examining the fuel control linkage for security.", "probable_cause": "The improper inspection of the aircraft by company maintenance personnel, which resulted in an unsafetied and disconnected fuel control arm."}
