Few minutes later, the pilot reported an unexpected situation to ATC and was cleared to return to Yao. At an altitude of 17,200 feet and a speed of 150 knots, the aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent, partially disintegrated in the air and eventually crashed in a hilly and wooded terrain near the village of Yamazoe, bursting into flames. Both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "In the accident, it is highly probable that the Aircraft lost control during flight, nose-dived while turning, and disintegrated in mid-air, resulting in the crash. It is somewhat likely that the Aircraft lost control during flight, because the captain did not have pilot skills and knowledge necessary for the operation of the Aircraft, and was not able to perform proper flight operations."}
