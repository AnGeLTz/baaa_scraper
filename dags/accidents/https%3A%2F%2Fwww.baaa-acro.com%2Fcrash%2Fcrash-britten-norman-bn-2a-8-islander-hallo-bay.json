The beach was oriented north/south, and was utilized by airplanes transporting guests to and from a remote wilderness lodge. Weather conditions at the beach were reported to air taxi operators via satellite phone. The pilot reported that as he was departing toward the north, the wind was from the west about 30 knots, with gusts to 50 knots. About 20 feet agl, a strong gust of wind, or a downdraft, hit the airplane. The airplane descended and the left wing collided with the beach, which spun the airplane 180 degrees. The airplane came to rest in about 2 1/2 feet of water.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions, and his intentional flight into adverse weather conditions, which resulted in a loss of control and collision with terrain during takeoff-initial climb. Factors contributing to the accident were high and gusty wind conditions, and the pilot's inadequate preflight planning."}
