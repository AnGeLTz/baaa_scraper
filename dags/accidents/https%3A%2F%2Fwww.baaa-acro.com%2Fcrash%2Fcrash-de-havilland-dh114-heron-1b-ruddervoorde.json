In June, a ferry permit was issued and on July 11, it was decided to ferry the airplane from Charleroi to London-Gatwick Airport. The pilot departed Charleroi-Gosselies Airport at 1551LT. At 1634LT, while at cruising altitude, the engine n\u00b04 suffered vibrations and the pilot decided to shut it down. Three minutes later, the engine n\u00b03 emitted smoke then caught fire. The pilot was able to shut it down but for unknown reason could not feather its propeller. He reduced his altitude and attempted to make an emergency landing when the airplane struck trees and crash landed in a potatoes field. The pilot was unhurt while the aircraft was considered as damaged beyond repair. The pilot's total flying hours was 8,530 with zero experience on this type of aircraft. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of two engines in flight due to the non-observation of the procedure published by the manufacturer regarding the engine start-up following a long standstill period. "}
