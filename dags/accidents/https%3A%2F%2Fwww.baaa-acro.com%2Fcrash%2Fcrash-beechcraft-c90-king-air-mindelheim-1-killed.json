While completing a sharp turn to the right at a relative low altitude, the aircraft stalled and crashed in a field located less than 2 km from the airfield. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot, sole on board, was killed. The aircraft was operated by Burkhart Grob Luft-und-Raumfahrt later renamed Grob Aerospace.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the fuel filler cap on the right fuel tank was missing and fuel was leaking, necessitating an emergency return. While completing a last turn to the right, the aircraft stalled because its speed was insufficient and the distance from the ground was too low to expect recovery. "}
