About 50 minutes into the flight, the crew encountered technical problems and was forced to shut down the left engine and to feather its propeller. The captain was then cleared to return to Londrina for a safe landing as an emergency landing at Ourinhos Airport was not possible as it was not lighted at night. On final approach to runway 12 at Londrina Airport, the airplane went out of control and crashed in flames less than two km from the airfield. A passenger was seriously injured while 19 other occupants were killed. Few hours later, the only survivor died from his injuries.
