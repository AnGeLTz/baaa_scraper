The aircraft crashed onto the southbound lanes of the San Diego freeway at Long Beach after making a flyby of the tower to confirm the landing gear position. The investigation revealed an improperly installed turbocharger, a cracked manifold exhaust, a burned main power lead, a separated cylinder, and a low fluid level in the hydraulic reservoir. Two years prior to this accident, the instructor pilot made an unintentional gear up landing in another aircraft. One year prior to this accident the FAA revoked the mechanic's inspection authorization.
