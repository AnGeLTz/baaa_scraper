The airplane, based at Nha Trang, was bringing in a load of 13 tons of aviation fuel and it was 1st Lt Smith's first mission as aircraft commander. Enemy action was never actually confirmed to have caused the loss of this aircraft which may simply have flown into high ground in poor visibility. For some reason the remains of 1st Lt Wax were not recovered and identified until December 1996. \r\nCrew:\r\n1st Lt Donald Clayton Smith,\r\n1st David J. Wax,\r\nCpt Terry Fisher Katterhenry,\r\nT/Sgt William Henry Crisp,\r\nA1C Willie Mitchell.\r\nSource: Chris Hobson", "probable_cause": null}
