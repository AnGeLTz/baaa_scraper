Le\u00f3n Bentley Airport, the crew failed to realize his altitude was too low when the aircraft landed 8 metres short of runway. It bounced and landed a second time 300 metres past the runway threshold. Upon touchdown, the right main gear collapsed. Out of control, the aircraft veered off runway to the right, slid through the apron and eventually collided with a parked Satena PC-6, broken in two. All five crew members were injured as well as two technicians working on the PC-6. ", "probable_cause": null}
