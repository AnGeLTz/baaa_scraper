In flight, the captain decided to reduce his altitude and made a very low pass over the Tasman Bay. Propeller blades hit the water surface and the pilot increased engine power to gain altitude. At a height of 200 feet, the aircraft went out of control, the pilot was able to send a brief mayday message and ditched the aircraft. Ten minutes later, the pilot of a RNZAF's Harvard spotted the Hudson floating with all crew alive, seating on both wings. Unfortunately, more than two hours were needed for the crew of a RNZAF ship to rich the site. Only one crew was found alive as all six other occupants died from hypothermia because the water temperature was too low.\r\nCrew (2nd Squadron):\r\nF/O Dean Horrocks, \u2020\r\nSgt Vincent Hill, \u2020\r\nSgt Jack Bryson, \u2020\r\nSgt Victor Chapple, \u2020\r\nSgt Gordon Stevens, \u2020\r\nAC1 John Davis, \u2020\r\nW/O J.
