About three minutes after liftoff, the aircraft struck the slope of Mt Padre Amaya located 8 km from the airport. The wreckage was found 30 metres below the summit. A passenger was found alive while 14 other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the crew in the flight technique applied during the take-off phase, by not evaluating the performance of the aircraft, considering the high weight in front of the obstacles to climb over on the ascent trajectory.\r\nThe following contributing factors were reported: \r\n- Errors presented in the dispatch, since the weights were not totaled correctly, possibly due to errors in the handling of cargo and unaccompanied luggage.\r\n- Attitude of complacency on the part of the crew, due to excellent meteorological conditions that caused an excess of confidence in the planning of the flight on the part of the crew."}
