On approach to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with thunderstorm activity and limited visibility due to rain showers. Following a wrong approach configuration, the aircraft landed hard on runway 09L with a rate of descent of 2,000 feet per minute. On impact, the undercarriage and the tail were torn off and the airplane slid on the wet runway before coming to rest in flames. Three occupants were injured while seven others escaped unhurt. The aircraft was destroyed by a ground fire. \n", "probable_cause": "The decision of the pilot to initiate and continue an instrument approach under weather conditions which precluded adequate visual reference and the faulty techniques used by the pilot during the landing phase of that approach. The Safety Board also finds that the flight crew's non-adherence to prescribed operational practices and procedures compromised the safe operation of the flight."}
