During the takeoff roll, a tire on one of the main landing gear failed. The crew continued the flight, informed ATC about his situation and preferred to divert to S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos Airport that offered longer runway for an emergency landing. After touchdown by night, the aircraft deviated to the right then veered off runway. The left main gear collapsed and the aircraft came to rest in a grassy area. All three occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
