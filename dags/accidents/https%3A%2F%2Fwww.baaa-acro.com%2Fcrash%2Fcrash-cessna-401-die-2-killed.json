While flying over Dr\u00f4me at an altitude of 3,000 meters in good weather conditions, the airplane collided with a Robin DR-308 registered F-BSLO. The pilot, sole on board, departed Gap Airfield at 1230LT bound for Chartres via Moulins, towing two gliders on behalf of the Bertin de Chatenay Aeroclub. Immediately after the collision, the pilots of both gliders were able to detach and landed safely. Out of control, both aircraft dove into the ground and crashed on the slope of Mt Salaure, at an altitude of 1,100 meters. Both aircraft were totally destroyed and all three occupants were killed.
