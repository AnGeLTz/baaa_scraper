According to eyewitnesses, as the aircraft left the runway, it made an abnormally steep climb to an altitude of approximately 2,000 feet.  Fire started coming from the jet engines and pieces of metal began flying off the engine cowlings and mounts.  The aircraft stalled, executed an abrupt, right wingover and appeared to level off.  But, at an altitude of approximately 500 feet, the plane nose dived and crashed in a stubbled wheat field one mile west of the base.  Exploding jet fuel sent a large column of smoke into the sky, attracting scores of curious onlookers. A crew member was injured while eight other occupants were killed:\r\nCrew:\r\nMaj Ralph Romaine Alworth, \u2020\r\nCpt Douglas Earl Gray, \u2020\r\n1st Lt James Dennis Mann, \u2020\r\nCol Clarence Arthur Neely, \u2020\r\nCpt Thomas N.
