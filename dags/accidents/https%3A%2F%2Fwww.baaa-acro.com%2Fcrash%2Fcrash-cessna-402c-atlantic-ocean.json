The pilot estimated fuel on board during pre-flight from the electronic fuel gauges. The aircraft flew two hours and 16 minutes before the engines quit in a mode of fuel exhaustion with surging prior to stopping. Post accident investigation using fuel slips revealed a fuel burn within 10 to 15 gallons of fuel exhaustion. The fuel gauges failed on the last leg of the flight and the passengers stated the pilot paid a lot of attention to these gauges. The pilot wanted to divert to Freeport but did not because the weather was below minimums. After ditching the aircraft sank in 800 feet of water. All three occupants were rescued.
