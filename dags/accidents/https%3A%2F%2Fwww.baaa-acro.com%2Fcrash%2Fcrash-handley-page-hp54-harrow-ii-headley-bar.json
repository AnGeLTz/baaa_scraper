In the Tadcaster area bad weather was encountered and the pilot of the aircraft was intending to force-land on the former First World War airstrip at Bramham, to the west of Tadcaster. The aircraft hit a bank nearby at Headley Bar and crashed. With this being an outdated aircraft it was deemed not worth repairable and was written off.\r\nSource: http://www.yorkshire-aircraft.co.uk", "probable_cause": null}
