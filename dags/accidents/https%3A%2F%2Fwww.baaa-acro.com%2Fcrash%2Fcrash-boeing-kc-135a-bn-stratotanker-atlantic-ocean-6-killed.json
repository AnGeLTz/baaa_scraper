It was flying with a second USAF Boeing KC-135A-BN Stratotanker registered 61-0322 and carrying a crew of five. The first KC-135 was flying at an altitude of 36,000 feet while the second was following at an altitude of 35,500 feet. En route, both airplanes went into a low pressure area and apparently collided. All contacts were lost at 1230LT. SAR operations were conducted and some debris were found a day later some 480 km west of Bermuda. All 11 crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Due to the lack of evidences, the exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, it is believed that both Stratotanker collided in flight, maybe following a loss of speed and altitude from the first aircraft after it encountered downdraft or atmospheric turbulences. "}
