En route, the airplane disappeared in unclear circumstances. As it failed to arrive in Elmendorf, extensive SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended a month later as no trace of the aircraft nor the 20 occupants was found. ", "probable_cause": "In the absence of evidence, the cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, it is believed that the aircraft was off course at the time of the accident, apparently following issues with radio frequencies between two stations. Following this second accident in Alaska in one week and the third involving a C-119 in the same period, the US government reclaimed funds to modernize the ATC infrastructure in Alaska and to equip the area with VHF beacons."}
