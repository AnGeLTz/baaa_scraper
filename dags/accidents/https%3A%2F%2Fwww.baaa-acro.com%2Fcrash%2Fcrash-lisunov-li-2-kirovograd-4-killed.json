While approaching Kirovograd Airport by night, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with a limited visibility due to fog, a worse situation than predicted. On final, while at an altitude of 40 meters, the instructor in command was unable to locate the runway and decided to continue the approach. Doing so, he failed to realize that the airplane banked right to an angle of 20\u00b0 and lost altitude when it struck the ground and came to rest in flames 400 meters to the right of the approach path. Four crew members were killed and seven other occupants were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong decision on part of the instructor who decided to continue the approach in below minima weather conditions. Taking into consideration the fact that the crew was unable to locate the runway at decision height, the instructor should make a go around and divert to another airport or returning to his departure point.
