One minute after a night takeoff from Libreville-L\u00e9on Mba Airport, while climbing, the left engine failed. In a certain confusion, the captain mistakenly shut down the right engine. The aircraft lost height and crashed in the sea about 500 metres offshore. The aircraft sank and all 30 occupants were killed. It was reported that the aircraft has not been operated between December 21, 1992 and April 21, 1993 and was eventually requisitioned by the Zambian Government to carry the National Football Team to Senegal. A maintenance control (check A & B) was conducted between April 22 and 26, the day prior to departure. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the left engine failed due to excessive carbon deposit. Also, oil filters were clogged and electrical cables showed sign of overheating. The engine failed during initial climb due to inadequate maintenance. It was also reported that the captain was tired at the time of the accident due to intense schedule the preceding days following a tour in Mauritius with an insufficient rest time. Poor crew coordination, fatigue and lack of concentration were considered as contributing factors.   "}
