They realized there would not be enough fuel reserves for an IFR flight to Aspen, so they elected to divert to Eagle, CO. However, their landing at Eagle was delayed due to a snowplow (with no radio) on the runway. After circling and reentering final approach, the aircrew noted that the snowplow was still on the runway, headed in their direction. They continued their approach and the snowplow cleared the runway. According to the snowplow operator, the aircraft was 100 to 200 feet agl when it crossed the threshold. A FSS specialist noted that the aircraft was still airborne when it passed the 2nd turnoff, approximately 2,300 feet from the threshold. After touching down on the snow covered runway, the pilot deployed the spoilers and immediately applied braking action, but was unable to stop on the remaining runway. The aircraft continued off the end of the runway, went down a 15 feet bank and ran into a small ravine. The runway gradient was 1.4% downhill, elev 6,538 feet. Drag chute was not deployed, 600 lbs fuel remaining. All six occupants were evacuated, among them five were injured, one seriously.
