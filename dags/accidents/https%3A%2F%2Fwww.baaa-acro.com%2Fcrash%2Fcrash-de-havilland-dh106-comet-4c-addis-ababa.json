On final, at an altitude of 150 feet, the pilot-in-command made a visual contact with runway 32 but the aircraft was 250 feet to the right of the extended centerline. The captain decided to make a turn to the left when the aircraft banked left, lost height and struck the ground. Out of control, it crashed by the runway and came to rest. All 14 occupants were injured and the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who continued the approach below minima weather conditions and passed the minimum descent altitude without any visual contact with the ground or runway. In such conditions, the captain should make a go-around procedure."}
