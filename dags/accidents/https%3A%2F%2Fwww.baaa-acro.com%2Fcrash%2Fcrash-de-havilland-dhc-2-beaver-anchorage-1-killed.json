The upper half of the control column was replaced with a throw-over yoke and the aileron system was rerigged. The pilot-in-command picked up the airplane after it was tied down outside for three months. According to a witness, the airplane lifted off the water and started a left bank which increased until the airplane struck the ground. Post accident examination revealed the control cables at the base of the control column operated in reverse of the description in the maintenance manual. Complete control continuity could not be concluded because of the extensive post impact fire which destroyed the overhead bellcrank, pulley, and interconnect system. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
