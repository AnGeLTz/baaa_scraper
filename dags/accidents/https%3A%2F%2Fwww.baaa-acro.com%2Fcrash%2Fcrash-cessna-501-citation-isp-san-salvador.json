On approach to runway 25, the copilot informed the captain about a discrepancy between both altimeters. The crew elected to identify the problem and thus failed to focus his attention on the approach procedure. This caused the aircraft to lose altitude when it collided with trees located 2,500 feet short of runway and crashed on a road 1,200 feet short of runway. Both pilots escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
