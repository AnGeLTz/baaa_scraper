The crash site was reached by the rescuers three days later and all 31 occupants have been killed. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact and an engine and a wing were found about 800 meters from the main wreckage. ", "probable_cause": "Imprudence on the part of the pilot, who failed to maintain a greater safety altitude during flight over Sicily, and that, particularly, in consideration of the thundery formations present over the area. A contributory factor was the pilot's ignorance of real wind conditions on the route which led to a displacement of the actual track by 3\u00b0 with reference to that intended. The Commission finds that the flight safeguarding service provided by the D/F stations of Rome and Cagliari was accomplished with due care and that, without being asked to do so other D/F stations (Milan and Venice) transmitted bearing information."}
