At the end of the afternoon, the crew departed Valencia on the final leg of the day to Lom\u00e9, Togo. While in cruising altitude over the Niger territory, the crew informed ATC about smoke spreading in the cockpit and was cleared for an emergency descent and landing at Niamey-Diori Hamani Airport. On approach, due to the failure of the hydraulic systems, the crew was unable to lower the undercarriage so a belly landing was completed. The aircraft slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest, bursting into flames. All 10 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the in-flight smoke and fire was the consequence of an electrical short-circuit. "}
