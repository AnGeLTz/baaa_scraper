Few seconds later, the twin engine aircraft went out of control, dove into the ground and crashed in an open field located in Tangar\u00e1 da Serra. All four passengers and both pilots were killed. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact. ", "probable_cause": "Poor flight preparation on part of the flying crew who did not take into consideration the probability for an enroute deterioration of the weather conditions. Investigations revealed that the loss of control was probably caused by a spatial disorientation of the pilot in command who was unable to establish his correct position due to poor visibility caused by heavy rain falls. The following factors may have contribute to the loss of control by the captain: disease, visual and hearing impairment, arteriosclerosis, obesity and heart problems."}
