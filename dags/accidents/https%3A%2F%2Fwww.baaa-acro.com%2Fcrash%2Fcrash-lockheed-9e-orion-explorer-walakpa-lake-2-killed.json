Both occupants were killed.\r\nCrew: \r\nWiley Post, 37, test pilot by Lockheed.\r\nPassenger: \r\nWill Rogers, 56, actor.", "probable_cause": "A study of the effect of the various changes made on the airplane indicated that it was decidedly nose-heavy and must have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to properly control without the aid of the engine. A statement made by the pilot after the change to pontoons confirms this conclusion. The exact cause of the engine failure cannot be determined. The temperature at the time was about 40 degrees Farenheit and the failure could have been due to the engine having become cool while standing on the lagoon or to ice or water condensate forming in the carburetor. It is the opinion of the Accident Board that the probable cause of this accident was loss of control of the aircraft at a low altitude after sudden engine failure, due to the extreme nose-heaviness of the aircraft."}
