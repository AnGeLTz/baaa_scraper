The aircraft was fully prepared with 1,900 liters of fuel. Eight minutes after takeoff, while cruising over Paris at a height of 500 metres, the engine stopped. The crew attempted an emergency landing but the visibility was poor due to the night. The pilot tried to find a suitable open terrain for the emergency landing and eventually landed along the railway line near the Bondy Station. Upon landing, the aircraft lost its undercarriage and hit an electric pole, causing both left wings to separate. While the aircraft named 'Dragon de l'Annam' was destroyed, all three occupants evacuated safely. \r\nCrew:\r\nDieudonn\u00e9 Costes, \r\nMaurice Bellonte, \r\nPaul Codos.", "probable_cause": "According to the crew, a fuel line ruptured shortly after takeoff, causing the engine to stop.
