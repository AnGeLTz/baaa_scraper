The aircraft was seen to leave cloud in a steep dive, whereupon a wing folded and the crash occurred. It was believed that the aircraft had suffered inadvertent 'negative G' during the thunderstorm activity and as a result the bottom wing strut bolt had sheered, thus the wing was no longer correctly braced. It is believed that the US Military Beaver fleet had also suffered a number of similar fatal accidents under these circumstances.", "probable_cause": null}
