As smoke spread quickly, the captain opened a door and used a fire extinguisher without success. As the cabin was on fire, the copilot completed a belly landing in a prairie located in Castilla. The aircraft slid for several yards and came to rest in flames. Twenty people were injured while five others, among them three crew members, were killed. The aircraft was destroyed by fire.
