On final, while in a slight nose down attitude, at a speed of 140 km/h, the airplane struck the ground and crashed in a snow covered field located 5,280 meters short of runway threshold. Three passengers were seriously injured while 11 other occupants were killed. Few hours later, two of the three survivors died from their injuries. The aircraft was totally destroyed upon impact. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of a premature deactivation of the deicing systems while completing an approach in icing conditions with flaps deployed at 38\u00b0. This caused the aircraft to be unstable on its longitudinal axis and to come uncontrollable. Various flight tests to determine the longitudinal stability and controllability characteristics during a flight in icing conditions had not been carried out. "}
