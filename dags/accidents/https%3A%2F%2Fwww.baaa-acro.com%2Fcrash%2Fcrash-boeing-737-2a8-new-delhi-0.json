All 108 occupants were evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of the combination of the following factors: \r\n- The injudicious and imprudent decision of the Pilot-in-Command to hastily complete the flight in the inadequate time available before the notified closure of Delhi airport for a VVIP flight,\r\n- The dangerously unstabilised approach made by the Pilot-in-Command, primarily due to his failure to decelerate the aircraft in time, \r\n- The failure of the First Officer to call out significant deviations from the stipulated approach parameters, \r\n- The failure of the Pilot-in-Command to carry out a missed approach in spite of his approach being grossly unstabilised, \r\n- The inadvertent omission of the Pilot-in-Command to arm the speed brake before landing,\r\n- Touch-down of the aircraft at excessive speed and too far down the runway, \r\n- Failure of the First Officer and Pilot-in-Command to monitor the automatic deployment of the speed brake, and failure of the Pilot-in-Command to deploy it manually, \r\n- Impact of the aircraft with an 18-inch high cement-concrete cable duct in the kutcha ground beyond the over-run area,\r\n- The pilot disregard of procedures, regulations and instructions."}
