After takeoff, the crew was cleared to climb to an altitude of 150 meters and continued to the south. Few minutes later, while cruising in marginal weather conditions with rain falls, limited visibility of 2 km and low clouds, at an estimated altitude of 175 meters, the airplane collided with an Aeroflot Antonov AN-2 registered CCCP-15925 that was completing a service from Tyumen to Tavda with 15 people on board.
