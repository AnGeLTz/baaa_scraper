While climbing, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with stormy weather when the engine n\u00b01 went in whirl mode and detached. 11 feet of the left wing separated and struck the left horizontal stabilizer that was torn off as well. Out of control, the airplane entered a dive and partially disintegrated before crashing near Poland. All eight occupants were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nLt Cdr Francis William Dupont Jr.,\r\nLt Jg Donald Edward Merz,\r\nLt Jg George D. Nuttelman,\r\nLt Jg Ernest A.

It is believed that weather turbulences may affect the proper functioning of the engine. "}
