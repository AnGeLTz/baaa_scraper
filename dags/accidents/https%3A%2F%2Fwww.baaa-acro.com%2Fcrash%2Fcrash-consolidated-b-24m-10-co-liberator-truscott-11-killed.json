It is believed the aircraft became airborne early due to a noticeable hump in the airstrip causing the aircraft to suddenly climb approximately 20 feet. According to the witnesses who were part of a working party directly in front of the aircraft when it became airborne, the aircraft apparently veered left moving rather slowly, gaining little speed or height. The aircraft then rose to about 40 feet and then fell sharply to the ground a short distance away from it's initial point of take off.
