While descending to Bordeaux-M\u00e9rignac Airport in poor weather conditions, a technical failure occurred on one engine. The captain realized that it was not possible to reach the airport of Bordeaux so he reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing on a beach located three km north of Mimizan.
