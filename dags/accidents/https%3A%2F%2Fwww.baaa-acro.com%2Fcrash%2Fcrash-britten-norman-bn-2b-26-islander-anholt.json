During the takeoff roll, because the elevator trim remained in a 1,5 unit nose down position, the pilot was unable to rotate so he rejected takeoff. A second attempt to takeoff was abandoned few minutes later for the same reason. During a third attempt to take off, with a tailwind component near the limit, the aircraft lifted off when the stall warning alarm sounded. The pilot lowered the nose to gain speed when the right main gear impacted a sand dune. Out of control, the aircraft crash landed and came to rest. All eight occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The following findings were identified:\r\n- The elevator trim was not correctly configured to neutral prior to takeoff,\r\n- The pilot failed to abort the takeoff after the first attempted rotation, when the aircraft did not respond normally to elevator command,\r\n- The takeoff was initiated with a tailwind component that was close to the maximum permissible value.
