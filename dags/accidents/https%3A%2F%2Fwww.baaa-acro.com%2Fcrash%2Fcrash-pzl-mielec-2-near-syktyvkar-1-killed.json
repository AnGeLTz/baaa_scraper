En route, weather conditions worsened and both crew lost visual contact with each other. Approaching Syktyvkar, the crew was informed about the deterioration of the weather with a limited visibility of 1,500 - 2,500 meters in snow. Few radios communications issues occurred and while descending at a height of 150 meters and making a right turn, the pilot saw the second AN-2 and made a sharp turn to avoid collision when control was lost. The airplane crashed on the icy Vychegda River, about 13 km from the Syktyvkar main Station. While the aircraft was destroyed, all nine occupants were injured. About four days later, one of the passengers died from his injuries.
