All of the crew members sustained fatal injuries due to the high impact forces. Sometime after of liftoff, the core cowls of No. 4 engine separated and collapsed onto the departure runway, consequently No. 4 Engine Pressure Ratio (\u201cEPR\u201d) manifold flex line ruptured leading to erroneous reading on the EPR indicator. The crew interpreted the EPR reading as a failure of No. 4 engine; accordingly they declared engine loss and requested the tower to return to the Airport. The Aircraft went into a right turn, banked and continuously rolled to the right at a high rate, sunk, and impacted the ground with an approximately 90\u00b0 right wing down attitude. ", "probable_cause": "The Investigation identified the following Causes: \r\n(a) the departure of the No. 4 engine core cowls; \r\n(b) the consequent disconnection of No. 4 engine EPR Pt7 flex line; \r\n(c) the probable inappropriate crew response to the perceived No. 4 engine power loss; \r\n(d) the Aircraft entering into a stall after the published maximum bank angle was exceeded; and \r\n(e) the Aircraft Loss of Control (\u201cLOC\u201d) that was not recoverable. \n\r\nContributing Factors to the Accident were: \r\n(a) the Aircraft was not properly maintained in accordance with the Structure Repair \r\nManual where the cowls had gone through multiple skin repairs that were not up to \r\naviation standards; \r\n(b) the Operator\u2019s maintenance system failure to correctly address the issues relating to the No. 4 engine cowls failure to latch issues; \r\n(c) the failure of the inspection and maintenance systems of the maintenance organization, which performed the last C-Check, to address, and appropriately report, the damage of the No. 4 engine cowls latches prior to issuing a Certificate of Release to Service; \r\n(d) the Operator\u2019s failure to provide a reporting system by which line maintenance personnel report maintenance deficiencies and receive timely and appropriate guidance and correction actions; \r\n(e) the Operator\u2019s quality system failure to adequately inspect and then allow repairs that were of poor quality or were incorrectly performed to continue to remain on the Aircraft; and \r\n(f) the SCAA safety oversight system deficiency to adequately identify the Operator\u2019s chronic maintenance, operations and quality management deficiencies."}
