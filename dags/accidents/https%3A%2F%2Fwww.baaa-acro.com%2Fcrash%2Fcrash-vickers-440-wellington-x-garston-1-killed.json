Enroute, the pilot encountered poor visibility due to foggy conditions and was unable to locate the destination airfield. Eventually, he ordered his crew to bail out and attempted to make a solo approach to RAF Bovingdon. Due to fog, he decided to reduce his altitude in an attempt to establish a visual contact with the ground when the airplane hit tree tops and crashed in Garston, east of the airfield. The pilot was killed while all five other crew members were later rescued.", "probable_cause": null}
