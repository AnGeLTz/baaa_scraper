The airplane has the capability to climb at more than 500 feet per minute using only one engine. After declaring his emergency to the control tower, radio contact was lost. The aircraft was observed flying 90\u00b0 to the ILS final approach course at very low altitude banking side to side. The airplane crashed in a 70\u00b0 nose down position.
