The aircraft touched down on the belly at a distance of 2,140 feet from the beginning of runway 07. The aircraft slided on its belly for approximately 1,500 feet before finally coming to rest on the runway slightly to the right side of the centre line. The port wing tip and the port engine propeller blades had touched the runway just before it came to stop.

There was slight smoke near the bottom centre of the fuselage but there was no fire. There was no injury to any person on board. The aircraft was written off. ", "probable_cause": "The accident occurred due to aircraft landing without extension of landing gears on account of negligent flying by the commander disregarding the laid down operating procedures. Failure of the copilot to bring to notice of the commander the deviations from the procedures and to verify and cross check that gears were down was the contributory factor to the accident."}
