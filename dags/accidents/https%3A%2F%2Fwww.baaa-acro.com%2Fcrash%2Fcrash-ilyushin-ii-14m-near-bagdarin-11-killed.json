Following a successfully mission consisting of thunderstorm observation, the crew was approaching Bagdarin when he encountered poor weather conditions with low clouds and heavy rain falls. While descending to an altitude of 600 meters in clouds, the airplane struck tree tops, stalled and crashed in flames in a wooded area located on the slope of a mountain (827 meters high), about 28 km from the Bagdarin Airport. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 11 occupants have been killed.  ", "probable_cause": "Poor approach planning on part of the crew who failed to follow the approved procedures and adopted a wrong approach configuration, causing the aircraft to descend to an unsafe altitude over mountainous area and in poor weather conditions. The lack of visibility due to clouds and rain was considered as a contributing factor as well as a poor ATC assistance. "}
