On approach, the crew encountered bad weather conditions and the visibility was poor. On final, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alarm sounded in the cockpit, informing the pilot his altitude was too low. The navigator also informed the captain that the aircraft deviated from the approach path to the left by one km but the captain ignored these messages as well as ATC instructions. At an altitude of 206 meters, the left wing struck an electric pole. The aircraft lost height and crashed, bursting into flames. The captain survived and was slightly injured while 15 other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The captain failed to follow the approach procedures and ignored ATC instructions as well as GPWS and other crew member warnings.
