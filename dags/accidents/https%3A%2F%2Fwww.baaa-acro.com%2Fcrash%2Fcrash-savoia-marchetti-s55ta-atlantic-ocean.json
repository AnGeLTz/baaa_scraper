The group departed Orbetello on 17DEC1930, arrived in Kenitra on 21DEC1930, Villa Cisneros on 23DEC1930 and finally Bolama (Guinea Bissau, ex Portuguese Guinea) on Christmas Day. Due to poor weather conditions, it was not possible to continue so all crews observed a rest time on Bolama Island till 06JAN1931. This day, crew left Bolama without problems and continued along the route to Natal, some 3,000 km in total. At a distance of approximately 1,000 km off the Brazilian coast, crew encountered technical problems and attempted to make an emergency landing into the ocean. Several ships of the Italian Navy were cruising along the route, so all four crew were quickly rescued while the aircraft sunk and was lost. It was registered I-DONA, referring to the name of its captain Renato Donadelli.", "probable_cause": "Unknown technical problem."}
