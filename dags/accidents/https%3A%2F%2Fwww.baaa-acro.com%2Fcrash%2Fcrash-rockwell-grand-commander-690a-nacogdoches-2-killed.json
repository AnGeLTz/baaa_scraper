About 12 min after takeoff, the pilot was cleared for an NDB approach to Nacogdoches and instructed to contact the Lufkin FSS for weather and current altimeter setting. During the NDB approach, the aircraft collided with trees, crashed and burned. An investigation revealed no evidence of either an engine or airframe failure or malfunction. Initial impact occurred with trees about 700 yards east of the NDB site. Initially, trees were cut in an upsloping manner where the terrain sloped upwards. Elevation of the crash site was 530 feet msl. The minimum descent altitude (MDA) was 900 feet msl. About 28 miles north, the 1955 cdt weather at Lufkin was, in part: 3,500 feet broken, visibility 5 miles. However, witnesses at Nacogdoches reported considerably lower ceilings, reduced visibility and some hilltops obscured by clouds. A pilot witness reported light rain, fog in the treetops. Reportedly, the airport was below minimums. Both occupants were killed.
