The captain decided to return to Schiphol Airport but during the last turn, the aircraft stalled and crashed on an embankment located along the A4 highway, bursting into flames. Four crew members, among them Captain H. Silberstein, and two passengers (Mr. Hodson & Newman) were killed. 14 other occupants were injured.\r\nCrew:\r\nHeinz Silberstein, pilot,\r\nG. F. Nieboer, radio,\r\nG. Brom, engineer, \r\nL. J. van Dijk, engineer,\r\nJ. Haberer, steward.", "probable_cause": "Technical problems occurred on both left engines during initial climb due to a low fuel transfer. The crew should use the fuel pump manually but the flight conditions were difficult, so the low pressure on both left engine could not be resolved. The crew left the fuel tap on the manual position which may be considered as a contributing factor."}
