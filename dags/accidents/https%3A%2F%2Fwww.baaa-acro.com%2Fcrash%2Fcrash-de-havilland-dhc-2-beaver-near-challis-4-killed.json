He departed downriver toward the northeast, but the destination was a usfs strip about 7 miles upriver to the southwest. A course reversal normally would have been made about 6 miles downriver. However, a turn-around was attempted over a relatively shallow (bench) area on the west side of the river, about 1-1/4 mi from the departure strip; where, according to the operator, it could have been made under ideal conditions. The aircraft crashed in the bench area while on a westerly heading. It came to rest in an upright attitude with little evidence of forward velocity, but with severe vertical collapse. No evidence of a pre-impact mechanical malfunction or failure was found. All four occupants were killed.
