The captain, the first officer, and two passengers were killed; two other passengers were seriously injured. Both pilots and two passengers were killed while two others were seriously injured. Both passengers who were admitted in a local hospital for high burns were DJ AM & Travis Barker of the Rock band called \"Blink\". They were travelling back to California after they gave a concert in South Carolina.", "probable_cause": "The operator\u2019s inadequate maintenance of the airplane\u2019s tires, which resulted in multiple tire failures during takeoff roll due to severe underinflation, and the captain\u2019s execution of a rejected takeoff (RTO) after V1, which was inconsistent with her training and standard operating procedures. \r\nContributing to the accident were: \r\n- Deficiencies in Learjet\u2019s design of and the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) certification of the Learjet Model 60\u2019s thrust reverser system, which permitted the failure of critical systems in the wheel well area to result in uncommanded forward thrust that increased the severity of the accident, \r\n- The inadequacy of Learjet\u2019s safety analysis and the FAA\u2019s review of it, which failed to detect and correct the thrust reverser and wheel well design deficiencies after a 2001 uncommanded forward thrust accident, \r\n- Inadequate industry training standards for flight crews in tire failure scenarios, \r\n- The flight crew\u2019s poor crew resource management (CRM)."}
