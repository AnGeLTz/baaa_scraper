After takeoff, the pilot was instructed by ATC to proceed to the north. Seven minutes after its departure, while flying in reduced visibility due to rain falls, the aircraft struck a rocky wall located on Mt Mola de Montserra (600 metres high) located near the village of Bunyola, about 20 km north of the airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all three occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, the ceiling was at 5,000 feet with a visibility of 8 km and rain. The mountain was shrouded in cloud and thick fog. ", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the accident occurred as a result of the marginal VMC conditions which existed in the area where the aircraft was flying under VFR rules. The aircraft entered this area possibly due to the pilot\u2019s disorientation and inadequate preparation and execution of the flight."}
