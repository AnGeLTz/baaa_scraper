The pilot applied left brake and added power to the right engine but the aircraft continued going right until the right wing struck a hill adjacent to the right side of the runway. The aircraft came to rest in a ditch 110\u00b0 to the right of the landing runway heading. Examination of the right main landing gear tire revealed a large jagged opening in the sidewall which extended into the tread area of the tire. This opening matched one of the sides of a rock found in the vicinity of the frost heave. The aircraft maintenance logbooks were reviewed and found to have no record of compliance with airworthiness directives. Both pilots escaped uninjured.
