Eventually, the captain attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft impacted trees and crashed in a wooded area located 37 km west of Kirensk. All nine occupants were injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Engine failure due to the damage of the bearings of the planetary gear from the first stage of the compressor, leading to vibration and destruction of the turbine. It is possible the damage to the bearings was caused by the presence of aluminium or silicon oxide. However, it was not possible to determinate the source of this contamination. "}
