After reaching a height of 60 m it began to descend gradually, in a slightly banked to port attitude, and struck the sea about 2,250 m from the end of the runway, 4\u00b0 left of the extended runway centerline. The airplane was destroyed by impact forces and a fire broke out. All six crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was probably caused by a loss of power on No.1 and 2 engines following takeoff, which resulted in a gradual loss of height. The probable slow psycho-physical reaction of the crew, due to fatigue, may have prevented perception of the danger and the timely execution of manoeuvres to prevent the accident, or minimize its consequences."}
