The ETA in Bron was 1600LT. About half an hour prior to his scheduled arrival in Lyon, the crew informed ATC in Mont\u00e9limar-Anc\u00f4ne that he was flying east of Valence, approaching Grenoble, and that he was encountering poor weather conditions with heavy snow falls. Few minutes later, the aircraft hit the east slope of Mt Moucherolle and crashed at an altitude of 2,289 meters. The wreckage was found a day later and all 23 occupants were killed. Apparently due to weather conditions, the aircraft was flying too low and off track at the time of the accident, maybe following a navigational error on part of the crew. \r\nCrew:\r\nEug\u00e8ne Poulon, pilot,\r\nYves Lucchesi, copilot,\r\nRoger Bourgne, radio navigator, \r\nMarcel Wauthier, mechanic,\r\nMarcel Bouthien, steward.
