About 40 minutes after takeoff, the right engine suffered oil issues and the crew decided to feather the right propeller and to divert to Bromma Airport. On final approach, the pilot in command encountered low visibility due to poor weather conditions and was unable to distinguish clearly the runway. In such conditions, he decided to make a go around when the aircraft, contaminated by ice, could not gain height and crashed on the slope of a hill located 2,5 km west of the airport. Twelve occupants were injured and eight others were unhurt. Unfortunately, the copilot F/Lt D. H. Davy was killed.", "probable_cause": null}
