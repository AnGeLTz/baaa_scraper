The wreckage scatter pattern was oriented on a heading of 155\u00b0. Missed approach procedures specify a climbing right turn via a 325\u00b0 heading. The left engine prop drive gear shaft had evidence of both bending and torsional failure loads. There was no evidence of machining or rotational smearing. Two of the three propeller blade tips were bent aft about the blade face. The left turbocharger had a tension failure of the turbine wheel shaft. No smear marks were noted on the fracture face. Single turbine blade impact marks were noted on the housing. The n\u00b01 tach needle indicated 900 rpm and the n\u00b02 tach needle indicated 1,900 rpm. All four occupants were killed. \n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power\r\nPhase of operation: missed approach (IFR)\r\nFindings\r\n1.
