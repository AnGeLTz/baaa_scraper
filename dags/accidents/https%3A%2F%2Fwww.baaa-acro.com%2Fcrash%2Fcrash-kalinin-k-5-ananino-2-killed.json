En route, weather conditions worsened and the visibility was very low due to thick fog. Approaching the village of Ananino, the airplane passed over houses at a height of about 4 metres. Then the pilot initiated a turn when the airplane stalled and crashed in a field outside the village. The airplane was destroyed and the mechanic was killed. Seriously injured, the pilot was transferred to a local hospital but he died few hours later. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of a stall during a turn initiated at low height because the airplane' speed was too low.

Also, the weather bulletins transmitted to the crew were incorrects and conflicting. "}
