The aircraft entered a steep right downward spiral and crashed on the shore of the Caspian Sea near Nardaran, some 35 km northeast of Baku, less than five minutes after takeoff. All 5 crew and 18 passengers were killed, among them were 15 Azeris, one Briton, one Australian, one Turkish, one Georgian and 4 Kazakh. ", "probable_cause": "The gyro horizons failed after takeoff due to a malfunction caused by the fact that some counterfeit assemblies and instruments had been installed by KhGAPP during the production of the aircraft. While cruising at night and poor visibility, the crew lost situational awareness and suffered a spatial disorientation, causing the aircraft to enter an uncontrolled descent and to crash into the sea. The lack of visual references on ground was considered as a contributing factor. "}
