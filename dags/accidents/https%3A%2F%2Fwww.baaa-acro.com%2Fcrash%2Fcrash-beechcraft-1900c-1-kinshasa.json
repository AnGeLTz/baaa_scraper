On approach to Kinshasa, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with thunderstorm activity, heavy rain falls and strong crosswinds. After touchdown, the aircraft became unstable, deviated to the left and veered off runway. While contacting soft ground, the aircraft lost its undercarriage and slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest beside the runway. All 15 occupants escaped uninjured but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the aircraft became unstable at touchdown due to strong crosswinds. A inappropriate reaction on part of the pilot-in-command, an overcorrection or a wrong configuration may have been a contributing factor. "}
