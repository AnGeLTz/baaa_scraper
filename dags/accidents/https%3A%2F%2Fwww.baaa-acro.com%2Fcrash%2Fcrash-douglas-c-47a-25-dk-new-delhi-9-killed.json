The airplane stalled and crashed in a field, killing all nine occupants. ", "probable_cause": "On account of the inclined attitude of the plane at the critical period during a steep turn of some duration, the port engine very likely became starved of fuel, as it was being fed from the port main tank which unlike the starboard which had more than adequate supply, at the time contained only about 18 gallons of petrol, a quantity inadequate to feed the engine in that position."}
