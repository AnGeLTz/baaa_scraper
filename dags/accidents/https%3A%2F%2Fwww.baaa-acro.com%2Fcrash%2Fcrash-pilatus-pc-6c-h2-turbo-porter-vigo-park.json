The \"throttle would not move from the flight idle position and the propeller went into BETA.\" The airplane pitched downward as the pilot continued to try and \"push the throttle lever forward.\" The airplane established \"a rate of descent in excess of 10,000 feet per minute at a near vertical attitude.\" The pilot initiated an evacuation of the airplane and deployed his parachute (the pilot was wearing a sport parachute during the flight).

The reason for the loss of propeller pitch control could not be determined.", "probable_cause": "The loss of propeller pitch control for undetermined reasons."}
