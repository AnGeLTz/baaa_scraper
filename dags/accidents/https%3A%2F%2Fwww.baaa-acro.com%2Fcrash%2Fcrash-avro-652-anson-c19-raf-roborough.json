On approach to RAF Roborough in marginal weather conditions, the pilot made a mistake with the heading settings (error of 20\u00b0). On short final, he realized he was not properly aligned with the runway and elected to make a last-second correction to avoid an ambulance parking when the airplane crashed and came to rest in a boundary fence. Both pilots were slightly injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew. It was also reported that RAF Roborough is difficult to access, poorly equipped and its runway is considered as too short."}
