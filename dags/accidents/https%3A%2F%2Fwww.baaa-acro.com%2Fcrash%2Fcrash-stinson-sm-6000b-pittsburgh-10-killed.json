Shortly after takeoff, while in initial climb, all three engine stopped. The airplane stalled and crashed. A female passenger aged 17 survived with serious injuries while 10 other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "All three engines failed after the fuel supply was cut off, and there were indications that the pilot had then allowed the Stinson to lose flying speed while attempting an off-airport forced landing, the accident occurring in darkness. It was considered possible by the US Bureau of Air Commerce that the passenger who had been sitting on two flare containers in the cockpit had precipitated the crash by inadvertently switching off the fuel selector valve with her heel."}
