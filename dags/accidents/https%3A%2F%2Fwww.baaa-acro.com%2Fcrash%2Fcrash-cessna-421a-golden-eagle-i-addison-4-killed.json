Examination of the prop governors disclosed an rpm setting below takeoff or climb power; however, exact rpm setting could not be determined.

The throttle quadrant location of the throttle and prop controls on the Baron are in the reverse position of those on the Cessna 421. The pilot also had not been check out in the Cessna 421.
