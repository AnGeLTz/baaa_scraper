On final approach in low visibility (dark night), the crew failed to realize his altitude was insufficient when the aircraft struck the top of a sand dune. The undercarriage were torn off and the aircraft crash landed 3 km short of runway, bursting into flames. Both doctors escaped uninjured, the female copilot was slightly injured and the captain was seriously injured. The aircraft was totally destroyed.
