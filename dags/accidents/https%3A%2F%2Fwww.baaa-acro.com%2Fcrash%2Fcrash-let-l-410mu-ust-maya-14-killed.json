Power on the right engine was increased till 96% and the crew continued the takeoff procedure. Liftoff was completed at a speed of 160 km/h then the aircraft climbed to a height of 50 meters and entered a left turn. Slowly, the altitude dropped and the aircraft eventually crashed in the Aldan River about 270 meters offshore. The wreckage sank and was found 31 hours later. All 14 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the failure of the left engine was the consequence of errors on part of the crew who failed to follow the pre-takeoff engine checklist. The aircraft's speed at takeoff was insufficient and the engine failure occurred at a critical stage of the takeoff procedure, causing a loss of controllability after liftoff. During climbout, the speed decreased because the crew did  not raise the landing gear due to high workload caused by an emergency situation. "}
