Upon landing, the aircraft hit the ground with a positive aerodynamic force estimated between 1,81 and 1,97 G. The aircraft bounced several times and eventually hit the ground with a positive aerodynamic force of 4,82 G. The nose gear collapsed and punctured the cockpit floor. Then the aircraft slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest. There were no injuries while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration and excessive speed upon landing. It appears that the approach speed over the inner marker was 224 km/h instead of 170-180 km/h according to procedures. Also, the aircraft's attitude upon landing was incorrect. "}
