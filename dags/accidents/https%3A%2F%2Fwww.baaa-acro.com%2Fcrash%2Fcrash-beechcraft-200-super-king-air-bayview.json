Subsequently, the airplane\u2019s landing gear struck tree tops before it impacted the ground. A passenger added that he \"noticed the flaps were up during takeoff.\" Approximately three minutes after the accident, a weather reporting station located 5.6 nautical miles southwest of the accident site reported wind from 010 degrees at 14 knots. Examination of the engines revealed rotational scoring throughout the first and second stage turbines.

A contributing factor was the prevailing right quartering tailwind."}
