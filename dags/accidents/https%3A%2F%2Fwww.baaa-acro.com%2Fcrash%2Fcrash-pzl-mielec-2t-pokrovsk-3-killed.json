The intended destination was in fact Prokovsk located about 70 km southwest of Yakutsk but the airfield was not suitable for night movements. On approach to Yakutsk-Magan Airport, the crew continued to Prokovsk where several cars were parked along the runway with their lights ON. Due to low visibility caused by night and snow falls, the crew was unable to establish a visual contact with the ground and two approaches were missed. During a third attempt to land, the aircraft collided with pine trees and power cables and crashed in an open field, bursting into flames. All three occupants were killed.
