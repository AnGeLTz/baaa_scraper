The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and all 16 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain after the crew decided to continue the descent under VFR mode in IMC conditions. It was reported that the wrong approach configuration adopted by the crew caused the aircraft to enter a valley which was not mentioned on approach charts. Due to poor visibility because of low clouds, the crew was unable to distinguish the mountain struck by the aircraft. The crew was misled by external factors inherent to weather conditions. "}
