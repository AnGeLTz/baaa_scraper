After takeoff, the pilot passed over Fontainebleau then continued to the southeast. Less than an hour into the flight, while cruising in light rain, the engine failed. The pilot reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing in an open field (he later said he saw a 300 metres long field to land). On short final, he saw a walnut tree and made a turn to the left to avoid the collision when the left wing impacted two apple-trees and crashed in an orchard. Five occupants were slightly injured, a sixth was more wounded and transferred to hospital. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair as both wings were torn off. \r\nCrew:\r\nRen\u00e9 Charpentier, pilot + one mechanic. \r\nPassengers:\r\nMiss Lily Florence Lane, \r\nMr. M. Mareuge, \r\nMr. Andr\u00e9 Leducq + one English citizen. ", "probable_cause": "Engine failure in flight. "}
