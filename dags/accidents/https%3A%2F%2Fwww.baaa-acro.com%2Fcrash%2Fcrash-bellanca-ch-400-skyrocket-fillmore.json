The pilot was certain that visibility was better outside the city when few minutes later, he encountered foggy conditions.

All four occupants were seriously injured and the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces. ", "probable_cause": "It is the opinion of the Accident Board that the probable cause of this accident was poor judgment on the part of the pilot for attempting this flight under weather conditions which existed at the time and for continuing flight up a canyon until engulfed in fog which could have been avoided and for attempting a turn in a canyon so narrow that there was not a reasonable expectancy of being able to complete the turn.
