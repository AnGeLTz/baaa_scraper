About 14 miles north of the airport, at 1,000 feet mean sea level (msl), the pilot encountered whiteout conditions and reversed course, descending to about 500 feet msl. The pilot requested a SVFR arrival back to the departure airport and began maneuvering to intercept the inbound course. While in instrument meteorological conditions, the airplane descended and collided with flat, snow covered terrain about 5 mile north of the airport. The pilot was unable to distinguish any terrain features until impact with the ground.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's continued VFR flight into imc conditions and a failure to maintain altitude. A factor in the accident was 'whiteout' weather conditions."}
