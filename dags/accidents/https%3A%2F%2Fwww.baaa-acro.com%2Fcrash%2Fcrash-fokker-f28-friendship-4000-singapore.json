On approach to Singapore-Seletar Airport, the copilot followed the checklist but failed to arm the lift dumper which affected the antiskid system that could not be used. After landing on a wet runway surface, the crew started the braking procedure but this was insufficient so the captain applied emergency brakes which is not recommended when hydroplaning is suspected. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, lost its left wing and left main gear before coming to rest. All 80 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was written off.  ", "probable_cause": null}
