An alarm sounded in the cockpit, informing the crew about landing gear problems. As the crew was unable to raise the landing gear, the captain informed ATC about the situation and was cleared to return for an emergency landing. Upon touchdown on runway 28, the right main gear collapsed. The aircraft slid for few dozen metres then  veered off runway and came to rest in a ravine. All five occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.  ", "probable_cause": "It was reported that the crew adopted a wrong takeoff configuration and that the rate of climb and gradient were too low after takeoff (positive but insufficient vario), causing the aircraft to collide with an equipment of the approach light system.
