The pic, who was in the process of taking her type rating checkride in the aircraft, failed to maintain directional control during a simulated engine failure after reaching V1 speed during the takeoff run. The total flight experience for the pic was 2,454 hours, most of which was acquired in multi-engine aircraft, with 387 hours being in the make and model aircraft involved in the accident. All listed experience in this make and model was obtained as second-in-command. All three occupants were killed.
