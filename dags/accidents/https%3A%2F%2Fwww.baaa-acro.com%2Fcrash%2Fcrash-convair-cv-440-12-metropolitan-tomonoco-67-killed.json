The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 67 occupants were killed, among them several Army officers flying back to La Paz with family members. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft was overloaded at the time of the accident. The departure procedure for Tomonoco Airport is requesting a high climb gradient due to close mountains. The present CV-440 has been modified by the army to carry more passengers than the original certification. As it was heavily loaded, the airplane was unable to adopt a sufficient positive rate of climb after takeoff until it struck the mountain. "}
