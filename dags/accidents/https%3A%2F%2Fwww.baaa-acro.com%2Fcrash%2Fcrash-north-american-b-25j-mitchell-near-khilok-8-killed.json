Some 52 minutes into the flight, the crew encountered poor weather conditions when the aircraft struck the slope of a mountain located in the region of Khilok. As the airplane failed to arrive at destination, SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended on November 11, 1944 as no trace of the airplane nor the occupants was found. The wreckage was located in September 1945. All eight occupants were killed, among them General Vladimir Ivanovitch Artamonov.\nOccupants:\nCol Vladimir Ivanovitch Artamonov, \nCol A. P.
