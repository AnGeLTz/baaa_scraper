The cargo arrived from East Germany by boat and was transferred to the airplane. During the takeoff roll on runway 23, at a speed of 268 km/h, the engine n\u00b02 failed. The captain decided to abandon the takeoff procedure and initiated an emergency braking maneuver. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, collided with the localizer antenna and crashed in flames. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 10 occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nDieter Hartmann, pilot,\r\nJochen Wilsdorf, pilot,\r\nHorst Umlauft, navigator,\r\nFrank-Rolf John, flight engineer.

Investigations reported that the captain first decided to continue the takeoff procedure but eventually decided to abandon and initiated an emergency braking maneuver. The distance available was insufficient. "}
