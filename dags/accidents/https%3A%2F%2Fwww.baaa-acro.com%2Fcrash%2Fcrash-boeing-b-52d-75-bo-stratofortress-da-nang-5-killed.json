While overflying the region of Vinh, the electrical system failed, causing some of the hydraulic systems to fail as well. The captain decided to divert to \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng Airport for an emergency landing. As the crew was unable to deploy the flaps, the captain attempted a go-around. Few minutes later, he completed a flapless landing on runway 17L. The B-52 touched down 1,000 feet past the runway threshold. After a course of 6,000 feet, it overran at a speed of 100 knots, struck a drainage ditch and came to rest in a landmine and exploded. The gunner was rescued while all five other crew members were killed in the crash.\r\nCrew:\r\nMaj Gene Wesley Brown, \u2020\r\nCpt James Thomas Davis, \u2020\r\nCpt Anthony Kent Johnson, \u2020\r\nCpt William Henry Pritchard, \u2020\r\nCpt Donald J.
