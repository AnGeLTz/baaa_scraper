The brand new DC-9 aircraft, which had been delivered to West Coast Airlines just 2 weeks earlier, arrived at Eugene at 19:34 and took off again 18 minutes later. At 20:04 the crew were cleared to descend from the cruising altitude of FL140 to 9000 feet. While turning to heading 300\u00b0, the aircraft descended below the clearance altitude and impacted the wooded eastern slope of Salmon Mountain at the 3830 feet level. The aircraft attitude was 30\u00b0 right bank, in a 3-4\u00b0 climbing flight path on a heading of 265\u00b0. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 18 occupants were killed.
