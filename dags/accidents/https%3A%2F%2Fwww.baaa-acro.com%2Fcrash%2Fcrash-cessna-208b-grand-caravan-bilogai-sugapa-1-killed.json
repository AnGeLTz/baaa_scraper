There were two pilots on board and the freight load was a mixture of food, palm oil, and cement. The aircraft departed from Nabire at 2355 UTC (0855 LT), the estimate time of arrival of Bilogai was 0045 UTC. At 0042 UTC the aircraft was reported above touchdown zone and the altitude recorded of 6,960 feet, direction 277 degrees and air speed 94 knots. The aircraft executed a go around due to an unauthorized person entering the shoulder of the runway 27, the aircraft then continued to climb and headed left. It was reported while the aircraft initially was climbing with the nose up but following lost altitude. During go around manoeuvre the aircraft attitude was in high nose up position, caused the angle of attack was too high and beyond a stall margins caused the aircraft stall. The aircraft bank to the right and crashed on a corn farm at coordinate S 03 44.58 E 137 0.96 and altitude about 6,550 feet with heading about 260 degrees.
