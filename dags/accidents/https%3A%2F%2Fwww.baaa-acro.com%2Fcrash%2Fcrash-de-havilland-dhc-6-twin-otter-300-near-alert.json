Equipped with ski, the aircraft landed on the snow covered terrain some 168 km north of Alert Air Base. After landing, the aircraft came to a halt when the right ski punctured the ice and the aircraft partially sunk while both engines were still running. All five occupants escaped uninjured and were evacuated two hours later by the crew of a Bell 407 to Resolute Bay. Damaged beyond repair, the aircraft was abandoned on site and later cancelled from registry in November 2011.
