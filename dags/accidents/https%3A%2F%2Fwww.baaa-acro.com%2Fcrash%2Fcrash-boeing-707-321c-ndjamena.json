After touchdown, the crew started the braking procedure and selected spoilers and reverse thrust. The aircraft started to veer to the left so the captain decided to reduce the use of the reverse thrust systems. On a wet runway surface, the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance and overran at a speed of 10 knots. The aircraft sank on soft ground and the left main gear collapsed. The aircraft came to rest about 50 metres past the runway end and was damaged beyond repair. All six crew members escaped uninjured.
