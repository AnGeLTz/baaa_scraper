He increased power on the three remaining engines in an attempt to make a go around when the aircraft stalled and crashed on an abandoned hangar located short of the runway threshold. Four crew were injured, five others were unhurt and seven passengers were killed. \r\nCrew killed were (115th Squadron):\r\nS/L D. T. Moir, pilot,\r\nG. Atter, flight engineer, \r\nG. G. W.
