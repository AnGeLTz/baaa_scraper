On final approach to Papeete-Faaa Airport runway 04 by night, the twin engine aircraft descended too low and crashed in the sea about 6,4 km short of runway. The pilot did not send any distress call prior to impact and the aircraft struck the water surface in a flat attitude. All five occupants were killed. For unknown reasons, the pilot failed to realize his altitude was insufficient on short final. The lack of visibility and visual references were considered as contributing factors.
