Focused on this problem, he failed to hear and understand the instruction of the captain to lower the gear. In such circumstances, the airplane landed on its belly on runway 16 and slid for 875 meters before coming to rest in flames. All 20 occupants were quickly evacuated and uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. Apparently, the crew failed to hear the gear alarm. ", "probable_cause": "Belly landing caused by a crew error. The following factors were considered as contributing: \r\n- Poor planned approach, \r\n- Lack of crew coordination, \r\n- Lack of crew concentration."}
