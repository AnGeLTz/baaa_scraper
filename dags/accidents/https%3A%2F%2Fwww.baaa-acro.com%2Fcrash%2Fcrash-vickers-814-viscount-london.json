The crew declared an emergency and was cleared for an emergency landing on the same runway. For undetermined reason, the crew was unable to feather the propeller. Following a normal approach, the airplane landed and was stopped in flames after a course of several hundred yards. All 42 occupants were quickly evacuated and there were no casualties. The fire was extinguished by the fire brigade but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the failure of the engine n\u00b04 could not be determined. The crew was unable to feather its propeller that was windmilling, causing drag. However, it was reported that a fuel line located near the engine n\u00b04 failed, causing the fuel to ignite while in contact with high-temperature components of the engine."}
