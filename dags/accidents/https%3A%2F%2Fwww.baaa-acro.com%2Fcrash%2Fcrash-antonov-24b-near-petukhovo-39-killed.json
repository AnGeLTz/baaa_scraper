Less than two minutes later, the airplane went out of control and entered a dive and reached the speed of 1,000 km/h. At 2,700 meters, the captain was able to regain control for few seconds when the airplane made an upward looping and started to lose parts due to excessive g loads. Out of control, it went down and eventually crashed at a speed of 250 km/h in a field covered by 70 cm of snow and located near Petukhovo, about 90 km north of Perm. The wreckage was found at 1400LT on January 22 and all 39 occupants have been killed.
