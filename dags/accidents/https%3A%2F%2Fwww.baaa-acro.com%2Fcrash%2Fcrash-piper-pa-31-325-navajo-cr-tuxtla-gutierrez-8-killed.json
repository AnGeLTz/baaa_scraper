During initial climb, after being cleared to climb to 12,500 feet, the crew informed ATC he was returning to the airport. Shortly later, the aircraft lost height and crashed in a field, bursting into flames. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 8 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "One of the engine failed after takeoff due to a fuel pump malfunction. The crew elected to return but the aircraft stalled due to an insufficient speed. Poor engine maintenance was considered as a contributing factor as well as the fact that the crew initiated the flight while the aircraft's weight was above the allowable MTOW. "}
