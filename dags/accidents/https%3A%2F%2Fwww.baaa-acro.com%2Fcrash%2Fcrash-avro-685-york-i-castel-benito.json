There were no injuries but all the passengers were suspended upside down in their seats by their seatbelts. The only reason they all got out was that, mercifully, the York didn\u2019t catch fire despite being full of fuel for the sector it was starting.\r\nThanks to Andy Frish for his testimony and pictures.
