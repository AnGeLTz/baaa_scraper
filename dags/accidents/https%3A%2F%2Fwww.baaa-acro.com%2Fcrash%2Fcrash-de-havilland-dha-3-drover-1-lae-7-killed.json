While flying in a visibility of two miles due to rain falls, the pilot lost control of the aircraft that crashed in to the Huon Gulf, about four miles south of Lae Airport. Some debris were found around noon and all seven occupants were killed, among them the pilot Captain J. W. Spiers. \r\nSource:\r\nhttp://www.goodall.com.au/australian-aviation/drover/drover.htm", "probable_cause": "The initial finding of investigation by DCA and QEA was a pilot error in that he continued the flight under VFR into reduced visibility in low cloud and rain. The wreckage salvaged included the centre propeller which was missing blade. This was assumed to be caused by the impact with the sea. However, after the ditching of VH-DHA on 16APR1952, renewed investigations revealed that the missing centre propeller blade had suffered a structural failure and broke away in flight, causing the engine to pull out of its mounting and the pilot to lose control of the aircraft that crashed into the sea."}
