About 70 km from the destination, the crew was cleared to descend from 6,000 to 3,600 meters. At this time, weather conditions were marginal with limited visibility and low ceiling. During the descent, several radios contacts were made between ATC and pilots but most of them were inaudible and the crew continued the descent without knowing his exact position and without any visual contact with ground obstacles. At 1908LT, the airplane struck the slope of a mountain (2,370 meters high) located 56 km east of Alma-Ata Airport. The wreckage was found 22 meters below the summit and all nine occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- The flying crew failed to follow ATC instructions, \r\n- Poor radio communication quality during the last two minutes prior to the accident, probably due to the mountain range, \r\n- Lack of ATC assistance.
