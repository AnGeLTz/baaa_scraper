Truman Airport, the airplane bounced twice and eventually landed firmly after a course of 2,700 feet (runway 09 is 4,650 feet long). At this time, the right wing struck the runway surface. Out of control, the airplane overran, went through a fence and a road before coming to rest in flames against a hill. The airplane was destroyed by a post crash fire and two passengers were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The captain's use of improper techniques in recovering from a high bounce generated by a poorly executed approach and touchdown. Lack of cockpit crew coordination during the approach and attempted recovery contributed to the accident."}
