Emphasis was directed to engine gages, fuel flow and counter, and power settings. The flight was flown at 5,500 feet. The pilot then obtained a weather briefing and filed a flight plan. About 15 minutes after departure, while climbing thru FL170, the pilot radioed that he had lost both engines. The aircraft was subsequently observed descending uncontrolled out of the overcast. At about 1,000 feet agl the right aileron separated. The fuel boost pumps were found in the 'off' position. The AFM states that the boost pumps should be on during climb above 10,000 feet. The pilot had been enrolled in an Aerostar transition school the previous month during which a 2-hr combined demonstration/flight evaluation flight was conducted. The instructor pilot recommended further multi-engine training. Both occupants were killed.
