The crew was attempting to fly an Instrument Landing System approach in instrument meteorological conditions at night. The LaGuardia weather reported 3 minutes after the accident was: '200 feet scattered, measured 300 broken, 600 overcast, visibility 1 1/2 mile, light rain, fog, wind 060\u00b0 at 11 knots, altimeter 29.63 inches, runway 04, visibility variable to 3 miles. ", "probable_cause": "The board determines that the probable cause of this accident was: the failure of the pilot to recognize the windshear conditions and compensate for it; the lack of crew coordination in that the copilot did not monitory the approach due to a self-induces communications problem and failed to warn the pilot that the aircraft was too low; and the diversion of tho pilot's attention from his primary task of completing the approach and landing. These conditions resulted in a mismanaged ILS and landing approach and the continuation of the descent into ground obstructions. "}
