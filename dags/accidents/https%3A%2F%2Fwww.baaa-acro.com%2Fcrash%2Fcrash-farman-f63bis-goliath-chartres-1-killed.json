The aircraft departed Ch\u00e2teauroux at 1000LT bound to Chartres. While overflying Bonneval, the right engine lost power. Rather than making an immediate safe landing in a field, the pilot decided to continue to the airport of Chartres located some 20 km north of his position. While descending to the airport, the right engine failed. Rather than making a straight-in approach, the pilot started a regulatory but not mandatory circuit south of the airport. Vertical to Saint-Ch\u00e9ron, the aircraft stalled and crashed on a small house where a family was eating. All six occupants on board the aircraft were uninjured. In the house, two children were unhurt while their parents were seriously injured. The father died from his injuries few hours later. ", "probable_cause": "It appears that the right engine failed due to fuel exhaustion. The flight was not properly prepared before departure from Ch\u00e2teauroux Airport. The pilot Jean-Yves Le Bail did not proceed to a preflight inspection and was not aware that the fuel quantity was insufficient. "}
