During the takeoff roll, after a course of 2,100 meters, the crew started the rotation when the airplane stalled and struck the runway surface before taking off again. Once it reached the height of 100 feet, it stalled again and crashed in a huge explosion 100 meters to the left of the extended centerline and about 150 meters past the runway end. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 11 occupants were killed as well as one motorist on the ground.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the total weight of the aircraft was high at the time of the accident and the pilot-in-command started the rotation prematurely, causing the aircraft to stall and to crash due to an insufficient takeoff speed."}
