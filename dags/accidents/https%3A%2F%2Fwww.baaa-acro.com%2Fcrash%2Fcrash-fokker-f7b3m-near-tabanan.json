While approaching Tabanan at an altitude of 1,250 metres, the pilot noted the presence of a ridge in front of him. Due to the topography of the terrain, it was not possible for him to make a U turn. He increased engine power but the airplane was unable to gain height so it impacted trees, stalled and crashed in a wooded area. All four occupants were rescued and the pilot was slightly injured.
