While on a downwind heading 150\u00b0, the pilot was assigned a heading of 270\u00b0 and was queried if the airport was in sight. The pilot responded '...we got it.' However, radar data shows the aircraft continuing the turn through 270\u00b0 to about 350\u00b0. After about 1/2 mile, the aircraft turned left to 250\u00b0 descending. The turn continued to a southwest heading approximately aligned with a city street that passes south of the airport on a course of 250\u00b0. The altitude decreased with a consistent rate to 900 feet when radar contact was lost. Elevation at the approach end of runway 36R is 724 feet. Wreckage distribution was along a 245\u00b0 heading. A flight inspection of the runway 36R edge lights at night during VFR conditions indicated the lights were not visible beyond 30\u00b0 of the runway centerline. The pilot got up at 0730 on 11/14.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with terrain/water\r\nPhase of operation: approach\r\nFindings\r\n1. (c) reason for occurrence undetermined"}
