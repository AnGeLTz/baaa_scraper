Two other similar aircraft left the airbase earlier and 56-3599 was the third of a series of four. At liftoff from runway 23, the airplane encountered serious difficulties to gain height and struck trees with its right wing. It then struck power cables and crashed in a huge explosion on the Massachusetts highway about 1,000 yards past the runway end. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 15 occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the flaps were deployed at a wrong angle of 40\u00b0 at takeoff. The combination of a wrong flaps setting with an heavily loaded aircraft and relative high temperature reduced the aircraft performances. At the time of the accident, the visibility was estimated to 2,5 km due to the night and low ceiling. No mechanical failure of any means and no in-flight fire occurred prior to final impact. "}
