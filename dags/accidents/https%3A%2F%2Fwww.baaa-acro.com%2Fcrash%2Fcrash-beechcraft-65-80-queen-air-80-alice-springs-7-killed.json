The aircraft subsequently struck the ground some seven miles south-west of Alice Springs Airport in the Northern Territory.

The aircraft was destroyed by fire and impact forces and the pilot and the six passengers were killed.", "probable_cause": "The probable cause of the accident was that, following an engine failure which resulted in severe vibration and a fire in the outboard rear section of the engine compartment, the integrity of the firewall and its attached exhaust ducting was lost and structure at the rear of the engine nacelle was thereby exposed to fire."}
