At a height of 120 meters, the crew was supposed to switch off the autopilot but the captain decided to continue in such configuration, using elevator to counter the autopilot. During the last segment, the rate of descent increased to 6-8 meters per second when the airplane struck the runway surface. Upon impact, the left wing was torn off. Out of control, the airplane veered off runway and came to rest upside down in a grassy area, about 400 meters from the initial impact. All 74 occupants were evacuated, eight of them were seriously injured. The aircraft was destroyed. \r\nPhotos via www.interflug.biz", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who completed the final approach with the autopilot activated and an excessive rate of descent.
