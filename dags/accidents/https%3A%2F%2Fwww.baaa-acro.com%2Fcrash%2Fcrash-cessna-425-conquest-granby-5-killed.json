She then canceled her IFR flight plan. According to ground witnesses, the aircraft made several passes over the airport. Witnesses also reported that the horizontal visibility was nil, but they could see blue sky directly above. During the last pass, the aircraft crossed over the approach end of the runway with the gear and flaps extended, angling to the left of the runway heading. Moments later, witnesses heard the engines go to full power, then silence followed. The aircraft was found where it impacted rising snow covered terrain approximately 1/8 mile south of the midpoint of the airport. There was evidence that the aircraft was in a steep descending, right wing low attitude when it crashed. No preimpact part failure/malfunction was found. A passenger was seriously injured while five other occupants were killed.
