The program consisted on an overflight of Klamath Falls, Oregon, Fort Dick, California, then over the Pacific Ocean and eventually Hamilton Field before returning to Pocatello with an arrival scheduled in the evening. The crew contacted ground around 0820LT to confirm they overflew Klamath Falls about one hour earlier and this was the unique radio contact. Nothing further was heard from the aircraft or its crew. As the aircraft did not return to its base, SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended after few days as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. It is believed that the aircraft may have crashed into the Pacific Ocean, along the Oregon or California coast, but no trace was ever found. \nCrew:\n2nd Lt Donald E. Benton,\n2nd Lt John J.
