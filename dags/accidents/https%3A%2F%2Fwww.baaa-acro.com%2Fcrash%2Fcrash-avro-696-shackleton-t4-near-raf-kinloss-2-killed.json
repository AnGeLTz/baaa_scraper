Few minutes later, in limited visibility, the crew did not realize his altitude was insufficient when the airplane struck trees and crashed in flames in a dense wooded area located five miles east of the airfield. Four crew members were injured and three other were unhurt. Unfortunately, the captain and one student pilot were killed. \r\nSource: http://tonycunnane.uk/page-261.html", "probable_cause": null}
