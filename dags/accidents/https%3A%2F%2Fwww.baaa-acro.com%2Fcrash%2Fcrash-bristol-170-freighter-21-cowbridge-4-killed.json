This flight was the second test one for the certification program. About 34 minutes after it left Bristol-Filton Airport, the airplane went out of control, dove into the ground and crashed in a field located in Cowbridge, south of Wales. All four occupants (three Bristol's engineers and one pilot) were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by a structural failure of the fuselage stern frame to which the fin was attached and must be attributed to the application on the fin and rudder of a load greater than the design ultimate load. Calculations suggested that the cause of this overloading was excessive rudder movement at a speed greater than 120 knots."}
