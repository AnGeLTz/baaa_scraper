The destination was Little Grand Rapids, Manitoba, on the eastern shore of Family Lake. At approximately 0845, while on approach to Family Lake, the aircraft\u2019s right wing separated from the fuselage. The aircraft then entered a nose-down attitudeand struck the water surface of the lake. The pilot and the 2 passengers were fatally injured. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces. The emergency locator transmitter activated momentarily.", "probable_cause": "Findings as to causes and contributing factors:\r\nThese are conditions, acts or safety deficiencies that were found to have caused or contributed to this occurrence.\r\n1. A fatigue fracture originated in the bolt hole bore of the right-hand wing lift strut\u2019s upper outboard lug plate, and eventually led to an overstress fracture of the right-hand wing lift strut\u2019s upper outboard and inboard lug plates during the left turn prior to the final approach.\r\n2. The failure of the outboard and inboard lug plates led to the separation of the righthand wing lift strut from the wing and, subsequently, the separation of the right wing from the aircraft. \n\r\nFindings as to risk:\r\nThese are conditions, unsafe acts or safety deficiencies that were found not to be a factor in this occurrence but could have adverse consequences in future occurrences.\r\n1. If operational flight plans data and load calculations are not available, there is a risk that, in the event of a missing aircraft or accident, aircraft information, including its number of occupants, route, cargo, and weight and balance information, will not be available for search and rescue operations or accident investigation.\n\r\nOther findings:\r\nThese items could enhance safety, resolve an issue of controversy, or provide a data point for future safety studies.\r\n1. The detailed visual inspection prescribed in the Viking Air Ltd. Supplementary Inspection and Corrosion Control Manual, and required by Airworthiness DirectiveCF2018-4, did not identify cracks that could form in the right-hand wing strut\u2019s upper outboard lug plate."}
