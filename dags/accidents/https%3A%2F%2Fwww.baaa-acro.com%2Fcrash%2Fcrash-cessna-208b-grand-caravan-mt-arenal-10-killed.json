The following findings were identified:\r\n- The pilot's unsafe flying and failure to maintain adequate separation (vertical and horizontal) with mountainous terrain and not remain in VMC. Moreover, lack of timely corrective action by the crew allowed the aircraft to fly in a controlled manner and unnoticed into the ground.\r\n- Loss of situational awareness and attention from the crew.\r\n- Inadequate monitoring and enforcement by the pilot not flying.\r\n- Lack of application or adherence to standard operating procedures established by SANSA.\r\n- Using flight procedures not written or approved.\r\n- Lack of culture regarding operational safety."}
