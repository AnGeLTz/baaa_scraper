On final approach, the pilot-in-command established a visual contact with the runway 19 and continued the descent. The aircraft landed 761 metres past the runway threshold. After touchdown, it was unable to stop within the remaining distance, overran and came to rest in a drainage ditch located 420 metres short of runway 01 threshold. All 13 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The contrast between the area covered with snow and the snow-cleared area (the runway) induced the pilots visual sensation about the runway threshold. This caused the crew to miscalculate the touchdown point, causing the aircraft to land too far down the runway. "}
