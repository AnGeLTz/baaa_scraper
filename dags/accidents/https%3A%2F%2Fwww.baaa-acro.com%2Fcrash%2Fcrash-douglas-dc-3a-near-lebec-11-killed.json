At 0341LT, the aircraft hit the slope of Mt White located 14 miles south of Lebec and disintegrated on impact. All 11 occupants were killed. It appears that at the time of the accident, the aircraft was off track to the east by ten miles due to strong west winds, and it hit the mountain 75 feet below the summit. ", "probable_cause": "The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the action of the pilot in making an instrument letdown without previously establishing a positive radio fix. This action was aggravated by conditions of severe static, wind in excess of anticipated velocities, preoccupation with an unusual amount of radio conversation, and the inoperative Newhall radio range."}
