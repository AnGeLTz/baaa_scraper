Later, while in poor visibility due to clouds, the aircraft hit the slope of Monti della Meta located few km northeast of the Picinisco village. SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. The wreckage was located by walkers in May 1946. It is believed that the crew misjudged the icing severity and the flight was not properly prepared. Heavy cumulus were present from 1,200 up to 5,000 meters.", "probable_cause": null}
