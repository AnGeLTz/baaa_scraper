While cruising at an altitude of 1,000 metres in good weather conditions, the airplane started to disintegrate in the air, losing several pieces. It entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a field located in Alkakhatki, some 60 km southeast of Tambov. The aircraft was destroyed and both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the student pilot probably made a mistake with the power lever while flying at a speed of 180 km/h. This caused the aircraft to reach the excessive speed of 260 km/h and to enter an overspeed. Several pieces from the wings, engine, ailerons and lower plant started to detach. The airplane then entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed. It was determined that the airplane was not certified to fly over the speed of 210 km/h."}
