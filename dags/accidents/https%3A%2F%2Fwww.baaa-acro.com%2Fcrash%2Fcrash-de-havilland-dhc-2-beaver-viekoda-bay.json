A 10 to 15 knot wind was blowing from the bay toward the land, and the pilot decided to approach over land. As the airplane descended over a small creek bed, adjacent to a hill, the airplane encountered a downdraft, and descended rapidly. The left wing collided with alder trees which spun the airplane 180 degrees. The right wing and float assembly were torn off the airplane. The closest official weather observation station, located 30 miles away, was reporting calm wind.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate evaluation of the weather conditions, and his failure to maintain adequate altitude/clearance, which resulted in a collision with terrain during the final landing approach. A factor contributing to the accident was the presence of a downdraft."}
