All 11 occupants were injured while the aircraft was destroyed. The pilot, inexperienced and unqualified in the DC-3, was making the takeoff with a 7-knot crosswind and with an unlocked tailwheel. ", "probable_cause": "The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident was loss of control at takeoff because of the inexperience of the unqualified pilot making the takeoff and because of the failure of the experienced pilot in the right seat to assume timely control. The accident sequence was initiated by the poor judgment of the pilot-in-command in allowing an unqualified pilot to make the takeoff and by the Regional Director's assuming the left seat which was contrary to his own operating rules to assure that this aircraft was operated by qualified pilots at their respective duty stations.
