While overflying the Iraqi Desert at night, the crew encountered poor weather conditions and decided to divert to Ru\u0163bah Wells. On approach, the aircraft was at full power when it impacted the ground in a 17\u00b0 right bank angle and 12\u00b0 nose down attitude. The aircraft crashed and exploded some 16 km from the Ru\u0163bah Wells Airfield. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all seven occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nWilhelm Marie Okko Anne Beekman, pilot,\r\nJan Johannes van Steenbergen, copilot,\r\nHendrik Abraham Waalewijn, engineer, \r\nGysbert van Zadelhoff, radio navigator.\r\nPassengers:\r\nDominique Willem Berretty,\r\nE. W. Walch,\r\nJacob Thymen Kort.", "probable_cause": "The cause of the accident is probably not related to a fire, in-flight break-up or lightning, nor related to failures of a technical nature. It is very likely that the very unfavorable weather conditions along with less favorable handling characteristics of the airplane in severe turbulence and fatigue of the pilot have resulted in a collision with the ground, which caused the catastrophe."}
