A first attempt to land was abandoned as well as a second few minutes later as the crew was unable to establish a visual contact with the runway. On a third attempt to land under VOR/DME mode, the crew failed to realize his altitude was too low when the aircraft struck the wooded slope of Mt Ungeo located about 7,5 km short of runway 06 threshold. Two crew members and 66 passengers were killed while 48 other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "The crew took the decision to continue the approach in below weather minima until the aircraft impacted ground, resulting in a controlled flight into terrain. Poor weather conditions, limited visibility, poor crew monitoring and wrong approach configuration were considered as contributing factors. "}
