With two new engines and floats, the airplane departed Saint Louis (Senegal) at 0715LT bound for Recife, Pernambouc. The aircraft named 'France Am\u00e9rique Latine' never arrived at destination and SAR operations were initiated. They were eventually abandoned as no trace from the aircraft nor the crew was found. Brazilian fishermen found a wheel of the aircraft on 18JUN1927 but this was the only element ever found. \r\nCrew:\r\nLt de Vaisseau Herv\u00e9 de Mouneyr\u00e8s, \r\nEns de Vaisseau Coeffin, \r\nMr. Petit, mechanic,\r\nCpt Jacques de Serre.
