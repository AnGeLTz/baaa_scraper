On final approach, the aircraft descended below the MDA when it landed at a speed of 190 km/h on an helipad located 159 metres to the left of the runway and 950 metres from its threshold. The aircraft collided with three parked helicopters and crashed. Both pilots, a third crew member and two passengers were killed. The aircraft as well as three helicopter registered RA-22313, RA-25144 and RA-25939 were destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The following findings were reported:\r\n- The crew did not have sufficient information about the deterioration of the weather conditions at destination, \r\n- The crew decided to continue the approach in a visibility that was below minimums, \r\n- The power of the ground light system located at the helipad was higher than the runway light system, in conditions of limited visibility, which caused a wrong perception of the crew.
