On final approach to Santo Domingo-Las Am\u00e9ricas-Dr. Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez Airport, at an altitude of 2,000 feet and at a distance of 8 km from the airport, both engines failed simultaneously. As the crew realized he was unable to reach the airport, he attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft crashed in a dense wooded area located about one km southeast of runway 35 threshold. All four occupants escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Double engine failure on final approach due to fuel exhaustion. It was determined that prior to takeoff from San Juan Airport, the fuel quantity in the tanks was sufficient for the flight to Santo Domingo. But the fuel cap was missing prior to takeoff and the crew applied some 'duct tape' in an attempt to replace the fuel cap. Despite the aircraft was unworthy, the crew decided to takeoff in such conditions. Because the fuel cap was missing, some fuel leaked in flight, causing both engines to stop on final approach to Santo Domingo Airport. "}
