After takeoff from runway 23, while in initial climb, the airplane entered a flat attitude then descended until it struck trees and crashed in flames about 3 km southwest of the airport. The aircraft was totally destroyed by a post crash fire and all three crew members were killed.  ", "probable_cause": "Investigations determined that the flaps were retracted at the time of the accident while the aircraft was flying at a relative low speed during initial climb. It is believed that this was likely a result of a premature retraction of the flaps on part of the flying crew below the minimum altitude of 500 feet, resulting in a loss of altitude."}
