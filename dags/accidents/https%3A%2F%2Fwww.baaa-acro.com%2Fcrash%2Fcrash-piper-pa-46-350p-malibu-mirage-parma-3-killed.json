The goal of the flight was to revalidate the PA-46 licence of the pilot-in-command. Following a successful emergency landing and a touch-and-go, the crew followed a new circuit and was cleared for a new approach to runway 20 in VFR conditions. On short final, while completing a left turn to join the approach path, the aircraft stalled, collided with power lines and crashed near a roundabout located about 1,100 metres short of runway 20. The aircraft was destroyed and all three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "A loss of control as a result of an aerodynamic stall while completing a left turn due to an insufficient speed. During the last turn facing the setting sun, the pilot-in-command reduced the engine power excessively, possibly after suffering a loss of situational awareness. The short distance between the aircraft and the ground did not allow the crew to expect a stall recovery. "}
