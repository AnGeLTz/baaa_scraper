After takeoff, the crew was cleared to climb to 7,000 feet then to proceed to the east via airway W9. About 20 minutes into the flight, after being cleared to descend to FL55, the crew noticed smoke in the cabin. Assuming the smoke was coming from under the panel instruments, the crew used the fire extinguisher put smoke continued to spread in the cabin. The crew informed ATC about his situation, reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing. The crew lowered the landing gear but completed a flapless landing in an open field. The aircraft rolled for few dozen metres before coming to a halt, bursting into flames. Both pilots evacuated safely while the aircraft was consumed by fire.
