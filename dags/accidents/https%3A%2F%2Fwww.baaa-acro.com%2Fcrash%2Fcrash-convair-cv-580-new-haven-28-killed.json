On final, the pilot-in-command passed below the glide slope and continued the approach until the airplane struck cottages and crashed in flames 4,890 feet short of runway 02. Three occupants survived while 28 others were killed.", "probable_cause": "The captain's intentional descent below the prescribed minimum descent altitude under adverse weather conditions without adequate forward visibility or the crew's sighting of the runway environment. The captain disregarded advisories from his first officer that minimum descent altitude had been reached and that the airplane was continuing to descend at a normal descent rate and airspeed. The Board was unable to determine what motivated the captain to disregard prescribed operating procedures and altitude restrictions and finds it difficult to reconcile the actions he exhibited during the conduct of this flight."}
