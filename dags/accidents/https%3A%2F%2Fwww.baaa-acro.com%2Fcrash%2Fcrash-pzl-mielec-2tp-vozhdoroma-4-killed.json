After being cleared to descend to an altitude of 150 meters, the aircraft entered an area of poor visibility when the crew lost his orientation. This caused the aircraft to deviate from the prescribed routing when, shortly later, it struck the cable of an antenna located in a military zone, about one km from Vozhdoroma. The aircraft lost height and crashed 250 meters further, bursting into flames. All four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The decision of the crew to continue the flight under VFR mode in IMC conditions (below weather mimina conditions) at an unsafe altitude and the failure to return to the departure point.
