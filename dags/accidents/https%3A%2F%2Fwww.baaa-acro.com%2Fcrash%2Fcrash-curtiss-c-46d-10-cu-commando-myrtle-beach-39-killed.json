The aircraft was totally destroyed upon impact and all 39 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Several eye-witnesses reported that the aircraft lost some pieces before it came down. Investigations determined that following the failure of a part of the right aileron, it detached from the wing, causing severe vibrations. The crew tried to maintain a flat attitude but the aircraft banked left and right and then went into a spin when both wings separated due to aerodynamic forces that exceeded their certification. In such conditions, control was impossible. "}
