For financial reasons, the crew refused to make a refueling stop at Lensk Airport and decided to continue to Bratsk. Unfortunately, weather conditions worsened at Bratsk and a landing was impossible. In such conditions, the captain decided to continue to Irkutsk and later shut down both engines n\u00b01 and 4 to save fuel. While descending to Irkutsk, both engines n\u00b02 and 3 failed due to fuel exhaustion. The crew reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing in an open field located 48 km from Irkutsk Airport. The aircraft belly landed, slid for few dozen metres and eventually came to rest, broken in two. All seven occupants escaped uninjured. ", "probable_cause": "Engine failure due to fuel exhaustion. "}
