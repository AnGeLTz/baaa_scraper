The aircraft then rolled for about 250 meters on a wet surface, veered off to the right, went through a wood fence and came to rest with its left gear torn off. There were no casualties but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Loss of control on short final after the crew encountered windshear at low height.
