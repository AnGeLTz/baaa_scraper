As the ILS system was inoperative, the crew was forced to complete a non-precision approach to runway 05. The visibility was poor due to foggy conditions. On final approach, while the aircraft was unstable, the crew descended below the MDA until the aircraft collided with power cables and crashed in an open field located about 1,8 km short of runway. The aircraft was destroyed upon impact and both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain following the decision of the crew to continue the approach below the MDA without visual contact with the runway until the aircraft impacted ground. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Failure to apply the concepts of Crew Resource Management (CRM).\r\n- Failure to use checklists.\r\n- Failure to brief the maneuvers to be executed.\r\n- Loss of situational awareness of the crew.\r\n- Failure to keep a sterile cockpit during approach.\r\n- Complacency and overconfidence of the pilots.\r\n- Unstabilized instrument approach.\r\n- Lack and/or non-use of equipment and systems to support the flight."}
