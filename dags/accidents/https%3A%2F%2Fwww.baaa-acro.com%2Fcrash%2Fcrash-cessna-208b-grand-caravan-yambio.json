The flight was uneventful up to and until after touchdown, twenty metres after the threshold of runway 03, when it was noted that the aircraft steadily veered to the left. Efforts by the captain to prompt the pilot flying and intercession by taking control of the aircraft and initiating the necessary corrective measures by applying full right rudder yielded no positive results. The aircraft left wheel entered the trench at high speed, causing the aircraft to flip over and crash 200metrs from threshold of runway 03 and came rest in an inverted position. All persons exited safely on their own, except two passengers who were assisted by the captain to disembark.
