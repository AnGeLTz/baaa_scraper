Twice, the approach controller informed the crew about his insufficient altitude but the pilot's responses were indistincts. At this time, the aircraft was about 1,500 feet below the minimum descent altitude. On final, the airplane hit the ground, lost its left wing and crashed in a field located 1,500 meters short of runway 14 threshold. 37 occupants were unhurt, six passengers were injured and a young girl aged three (Mrs. Delsaux) was killed. The aircraft was destroyed. At the time of the accident, the visibility was reduced due to bad weather and night. ", "probable_cause": "Apparently in order to maintain a visual contact with the ground, the flight crew decided to descend below the glide path, passing below the minimum descend altitude. The approach was then completed at an insufficient height until the final impact with the ground, in violation of the published procedures. Poor visibility caused by night and marginal weather conditions was considered as a contributory factor. "}
