The crew increased power and the aircraft was able to gain a little height when it stalled a second time and crashed 150 meters short of runway threshold. Both pilots and a passenger were killed while 12 other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew completed the approach at a too low airspeed according to the wind component and force. At the time of the accident, atmospheric turbulences and relative strong winds were present in the approach path and the crew failed to adapt his speed according to these phenomenons. The relative low experience of the crew was considered as a contributing factor. "}
