As they reached the Pennines they reported encountering thick mist and a strong head wind (up to 60 km/h). The aircraft became difficult to control so the pilot decided to turn back and potentially forced land the aircraft. Before dropping clear of the low cloud, the aircraft struck rising ground on Burbage Edge. The aircraft turned over trapping the pair for about half an hour before they both managed to escape the wreck and walked to an AA box near the Cat & Fiddle public house. \r\nCrew: \r\nWilliam James Alington, pilot.\r\nPassenger:\r\nH.
