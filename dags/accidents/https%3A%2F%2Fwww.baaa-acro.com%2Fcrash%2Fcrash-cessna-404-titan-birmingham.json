The pilot has stated that the initial takeoff acceleration appeared to be normal and that all engine power instruments were indicating in the green area. At an indicated airspeed of 100 knots he raised the nose and the aircraft lifted off the runway, however there was no further increase in airspeed. He retracted the landing gear and lowered the nose to attempt to gain more airspeed. At this time the airspeed had reduced to 90 knots and the pilot felt some vibration from the elevators. Realising that the aircraft would neither climb nor accelerate, the pilot selected what he hoped was a clear area in which to carry out a 'landing gear up' crash landing. All 12 occupants were injured, three of them seriously. ", "probable_cause": null}
