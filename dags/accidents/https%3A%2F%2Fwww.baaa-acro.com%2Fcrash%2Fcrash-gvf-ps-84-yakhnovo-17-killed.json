For unknown reason, he started an approach to the Yakhnovo Airfield located 8 km southwest of Khvoynaya. On final approach, while at a height of 30 meters, the aircraft went out of control, dove into the ground and crashed in a swampy area located 1,5 km from the runway threshold. The aircraft was destroyed and all 17 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the loss of control was caused by the simultaneous failure of both engines on final approach. This was due to an error on part of the flight mechanic who failed to switch the tanks in due time as there was still sufficient fuel in other tanks (about 150 to 200 kg). It was reported that the flight mechanic was tired because he made other flights the same day and failed to have appropriate rest time. Also, he was appointed to this mission despite his experience with night flights was insufficient. "}
