The student pilot attempted to turn back toward the runway and then saw that the airplane\u2019s airspeed was rapidly decreasing. The instructor reported that when he realized the severity of the situation it was too late to do anything. The student attempted to add power for a go-around but was unable to recover. The airplane stalled about 10 ft above the ground, impacted the ground right of the runway, and skidded onto the runway where it came to rest. Both wings and the forward fuselage were substantially damaged. Both pilots stated there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. ", "probable_cause": "The student pilot\u2019s failure to maintain control of the airplane during the landing approach and the exceedance of the airplane\u2019s critical angle of attack at low altitude resulting in an aerodynamic stall. Contributing was the instructor pilot\u2019s failure to adequately monitor the student pilot\u2019s actions during the approach."}
