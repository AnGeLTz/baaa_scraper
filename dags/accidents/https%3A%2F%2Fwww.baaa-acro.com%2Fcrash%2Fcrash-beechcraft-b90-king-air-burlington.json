He elected not to land on runway 31 since there were obstacles near the approach end. He stated that when the aircraft was about to touch down on runway 13, there was a big gust of wind which made the aircraft land long. As the aircraft landed, the pilot selected max reverse, but got no response. He decide he could not make a successful go-around so he applied max braking, but was unable to stop on the remaining runway. Subsequently, the aircraft departed the runway, went thru a fence, crossed a road, hit a pole and then the gear collapsed as it went over railroad tracks. A witness estimated that at about the time the aircraft was landing, the wind shifted to the north and increased to about 35 to 40 mph. Reportedly, the final approach speed was about 13 knots too fast. Skid marks were found on the runway, starting about 2,000 feet from the approach end. With a 35 knots tailwind, landing roll without reverse thrust would have been 3,015 feet. No malfunctions found, but it was noted that reverse system was inoperative above 90 knots. All three occupants escaped uninjured. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: overrun\r\nPhase of operation: landing - roll\r\nFindings\r\n1. (f) light condition - dark night\r\n2.
