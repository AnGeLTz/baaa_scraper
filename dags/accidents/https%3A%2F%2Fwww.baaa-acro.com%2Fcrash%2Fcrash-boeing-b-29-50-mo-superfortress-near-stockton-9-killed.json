The aircraft lost height, cut the path of the first B-29 and both aircraft collided at FL260. Out of control, both aircraft dove into the ground and during the dive, two crew members in the first B-29 and one crewman in the second B-29 were able to bail out before both aircraft crashed in a prairie located some 11 miles northwest of Stockton. The three crewmen who were able to bail out were found unhurt while all 18 other occupants in both aircraft were killed.", "probable_cause": "Loss of control following an engine failure."}
