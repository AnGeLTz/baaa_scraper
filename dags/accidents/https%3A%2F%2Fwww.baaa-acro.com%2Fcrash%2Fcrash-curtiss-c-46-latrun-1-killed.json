While descending to Ekron, the crew encountered poor weather conditions and the captain decided to divert to Tel Aviv-Sde Dov Airport. On final approach, the aircraft was hit by gun fire. In such conditions, the captain increased power and started a go around to leave the area. Few minutes later, while cruising a low height in reduced visibility, the aircraft hit the slope of a mountain located south of Latrun. Both pilots were rescued while the navigator was killed. It was later confirmed by the authorities that the soldiers in place in Tel Aviv Airport opened fire on the aircraft as they have not been informed that an aircraft would land.
