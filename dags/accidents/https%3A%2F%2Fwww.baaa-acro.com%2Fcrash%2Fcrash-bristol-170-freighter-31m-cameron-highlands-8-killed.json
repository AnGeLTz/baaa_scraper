The aircraft was destroyed and eight occupants were killed. As the airplane failed to return to its base, SAR operations were conducted and the wreckage was spotted in the afternoon. Rescuers were dropped off about 2,000 yards from the crash site but poor weather conditions hampered attempts to reach the wreckage which was eventually reached after three days only. The survivor walked away and was found alive twelve days later.", "probable_cause": null}
