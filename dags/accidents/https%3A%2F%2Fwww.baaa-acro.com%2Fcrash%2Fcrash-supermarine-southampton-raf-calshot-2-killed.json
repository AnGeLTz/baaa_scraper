It nosed down and crashed into the Southampton River. Two crew members were killed and two others were injured. \r\nCrew:\r\nF/O John Charles Francis Peacock, \u2020\r\nLAC Harry George Thomas Foley, \u2020\r\nW/Cdr Theodore Quintus Studd,\r\nAC1 James Barry O'Connell.", "probable_cause": "Wilkins of the Accidents Branch of the Air Ministry, said that the tail actuating gear was found in a fully forward position, which would make the flying boat extremely nose heavy. He thought that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the machine to take off from the water. In reply to the Coroner, he said that the responsibility for the position of the gear rested normally on the instructor in charge of the aircraft. The jury returned a verdict that the accident was due to an error of judgement."}
