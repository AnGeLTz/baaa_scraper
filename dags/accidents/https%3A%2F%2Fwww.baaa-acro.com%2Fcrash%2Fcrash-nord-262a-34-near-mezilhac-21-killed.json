The pilot was cleared by Marseille ATC to descent to 8,000 feet until Mont\u00e9limar then to 5,000 feet to Orange. For unknown reason, the crew started the descent prematurely and in marginal weather conditions, the airplane stuck the slope of Mt Suc de Pradou (1,342 meters high) located about 3 km southeast of M\u00e9zilhac. The wreckage was found about 200 meters below the summit and all 21 occupants have been killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nLt Pierre Chaintreau, \r\nAdj/C Jean-Michel Reig,\r\nAdj/C Jacques Deville, \r\nAdj Alain Gaudy,\r\nSgt/C Claude Touzeau, \r\nSgt/C Jean-Pierre Boutin,\r\nOff Alain Giblan,\r\nSdt Bertrand Courbier. \r\nPassengers:\r\nAmiral Robert Landrin, \r\nGen \u00c9douard Billion,\r\nGen Jean-Marc Pineau,\r\nCol Charles Birckel,\r\nCol Alain Rolland de Chambaudoin d\u2019Erceville,\r\nCpt Andr\u00e9 Bouteiller, \r\nJean Gaume, engineer, \r\nPaul Johann, engineer, \r\nJean Labussi\u00e8re, engineer, \r\nHubert Lef\u00e8bvre de Laboulaye, engineer, \r\nJacques Mabile, engineer, \r\nFran\u00e7ois Ronteix, engineer, \r\nGeorges Tirole, engineer.", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the crew may misunderstood and mixed both altitude clearances of 8,000 feet till Mont\u00e9limar and 5,000 feet till Orange, descending prematurely. In consequence, the accident was the result of a controlled flight into terrain. "}
