After several errors, the pilot-in-command started the descent prematurely and while at an altitude of 3,600 feet, the airplane struck the slope of Mt Davandyachi (1,080 m high) located about eight km north of Junnar. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 94 occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, the airplane was off course by 9 km and its altitude was too low. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was attributed to a navigation error which led the pilot to believe that he was nearer his destination than he actually was and, therefore, caused him to make a premature descent in instrument conditions for a straight-in approach to land at night. The aircraft consequently, crashed into high terrain. Contributing causes were:\r\n- Failure on the part of the pilot to make use of the navigational facilities available in order to ascertain the correct position of the aircraft,\r\n- Infringement of the prescribed minimum safe altitude,\r\n- Unfamiliarity of the pilot with the terrain on the route."}
