While descending to Chicago-Midway Airport, the crew encountered marginal weather conditions with clouds and icing. On final approach, at an altitude of 160 feet, the aircraft stalled and crashed short of runway. All three crew members and seven passengers were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nPhilip Cramer Scott, pilot,\r\nGeorge Sumner Young, copilot,\r\nFlorence Little, stewardess.", "probable_cause": "Upon the basis of the foregoing findings of fact and upon all the evidence available at this time, investigators find that the probable cause of the accident  was the failure of the pilot to exercise that degree of caution and skill required to avert a stall while approaching for a landing on the short northwest runway. A substantial contributing factor to the accident was the error in judgment of captain in choosing that short runway for his landing. \n"}
