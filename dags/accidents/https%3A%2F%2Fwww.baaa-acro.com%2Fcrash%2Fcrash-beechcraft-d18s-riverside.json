While cruising at 7,500 feet, the pilot decided to start using auxiliary fuel. Shortly after moving the fuel selectors to the auxiliary position, both engines lost power and would not restart. The pilot landed on a road, but the wings struck posts/mailboxes and then the aircraft hit a dirt bank. Fuel samples were taken and a visual examination revealed obvious contamination and discoloration. The aircraft had been given an annual inspection just before the flight. Both occupants escaped uninjured.  \n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (total) - nonmechanical\r\nPhase of operation: cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1. 2 engines\r\n2.
