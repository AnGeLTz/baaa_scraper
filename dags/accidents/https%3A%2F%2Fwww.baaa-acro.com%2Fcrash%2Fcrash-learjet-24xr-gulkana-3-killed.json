A search was initiated and the wreckage was found 7.4 miles north of the terminal VOR on the 330\u00b0 radial. The inbound course for the VOR runway 14 approach was on the 315\u00b0 radial. An on-scene exam revealed the aircraft was tracking inbound when it collided with trees, crashed and burned about 2.4 miles before reaching the final approach fix. Both engines were operating during impact and both had ingested considerable tree material. No preimpact mechanical failure was evident. The captain and 1st officer were currently responsible for flying both the Learjet and DHC-7 aircraft. This was the captain's 1st day of work after returning from a vacation trip to Hawaii (approximately 1-1/2 weeks). The 1st officer had an adequate period for crew rest prior to reporting for work; however, he had previously been working a varied schedule. The operator repeatedly shifted pilots from 14 cfr 135 rest/duty requirements to those of 14 cfr 121. All three occupants were killed.
