During the takeoff roll, the airplane deviated twice to the right but the crew was able to correct. At a speed just below minimum rotate speed (101 mph), the aircraft yawed to the right, the right engine power fluctuated and a 'bang' was heard from the right side. The commander decided to abort the takeoff procedure but the remaining distance was insufficient. He veered off runway then the aircraft struck a fence, lost its undercarriage and came to rest. There was no fire. All nine occupants escaped uninjured.
