According to the Board of investigations, it appears that the accident occurred as a result of navigational error. The crew  failed to make sufficient allowance for a strong on-shore wind and allowed the aircraft to drift over high ground before it gained sufficient altitude to clear the hilly terrain. According to the Hansard Report of October 7th 1942, blame was apportioned to the captain of the aircraft, \"Who changed flight plan for reasons unknown and descended through cloud without making sure he was over water, and crashed.\" Poor visibility due to bad weather conditions was considered as a contributory factor."}
