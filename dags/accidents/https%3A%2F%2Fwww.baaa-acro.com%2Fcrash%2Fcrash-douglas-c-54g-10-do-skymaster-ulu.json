On final approach, the crew realized his speed was too high so he reduced engine power and selected full flaps. The aircraft lost height so power was added. But the aircraft continued to descent and struck the ground short of runway threshold. Upon impact, the undercarriage were torn off. The aircraft slid on its belly, lost its both wings and came to rest few hundred feet further. All four crew members escaped with minor injuries and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
