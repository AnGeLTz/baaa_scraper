At about 0815 est, the pilot reported on company frequency that he was approximately 30 minutes from the destination (Orlando, FL). Subsequently, the aircraft crashed in the northwest part of Lake Apopka, approximately 15 to 20 miles west-northwest of the destination airport. A witness heard it crash, then saw parts from the aircraft, but did not see the actual impact. There was evidence the aircraft impacted in a shallow descent, while in a slight left wing low attitude, traveling at a relatively high speed. No preimpact part failure or malfunction of the aircraft or engine was found, though the aircraft was extensively damaged and some of the wreckage was not recovered from the lake. The Orlando weather was in part: 2,500 feet scattered, visibility 6 miles with fog and haze, wind from 350\u00b0 at 4 knots. Both occupants were killed.
