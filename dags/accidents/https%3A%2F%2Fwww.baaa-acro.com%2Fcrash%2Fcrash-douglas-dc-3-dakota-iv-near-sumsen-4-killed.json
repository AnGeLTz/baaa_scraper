The pilot had reported an engine problem following the first flight but it seems that operational pressure led to the continued use of the aircraft, despite the fault. It was seen at 1200LT at a height of 12,000 feet and the pilot who saw it reported seeing some smoke coming from one engine, but claimed that it stopped as the aircraft climbed into cloud. It was not seen again and is believed to have struck the ground after coming out of cloud. The aircraft was eventually found in an inaccessible hilly area of Burma, all the crew having perished.\nCrew (62nd Squadron):\nF/O Kenneth Herbert Roe, pilot,\nP/O Simon Gascoigne Eden, \nSgt John Roland Hyne, \nF/O Douglas Henry Loder.\nSource: \nhttp://scarletboy44.tumblr.com/post/53666675660/remember-pilot-officer-simon-gascoigne-eden", "probable_cause": null}
