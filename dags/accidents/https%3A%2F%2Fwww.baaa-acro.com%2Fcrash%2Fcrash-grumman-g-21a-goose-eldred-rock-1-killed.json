Six of the eight passengers and the pilot were seriously injured. One passenger died four days later. The aircraft, an amphibian, descended into the glassy water in cruising configuration from an established cruise altitude of approximately 200 feet. The aircraft received major damage from impact, sank, and was not recovered.", "probable_cause": "The Board determines the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the pilot to maintain control of his aircraft at a safe altitude during marginal visual flight conditions. A contributing factor was a glassy surface which caused the pilot to misjudge the height above the water."}
