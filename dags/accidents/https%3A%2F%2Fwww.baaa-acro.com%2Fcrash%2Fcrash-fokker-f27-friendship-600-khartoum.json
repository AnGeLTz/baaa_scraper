Following several touch-and-goes completed successfully on runway 18, the crew landed the airplane and elected to takeoff when the captain encountered difficulties to raise the flaps from 40\u00b0 to 16,5\u00b0. In such conditions, he decided to reject the takeoff procedure and initiated an emergency braking manoeuvre. The aircraft skidded on runway, overran and lost its right main gear before coming to rest against the ILS antenna for runway 36. Both pilots escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
