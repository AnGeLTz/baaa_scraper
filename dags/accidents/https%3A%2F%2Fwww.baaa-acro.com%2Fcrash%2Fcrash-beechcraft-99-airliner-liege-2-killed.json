The crew was cleared to divert to the nearest airport that was Li\u00e8ge-Bierset. After being cleared to descend to FL60, the crew contacted Brussels ATC and was vectored for an approach to runway 23L. Due to the critical situation, the crew requested a straight-in approach. While descending to the airport, the aircraft crashed in a wooded area located near Seraing, about nine km southeast of the airport. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Both engines failed in flight due to poor maintenance.
