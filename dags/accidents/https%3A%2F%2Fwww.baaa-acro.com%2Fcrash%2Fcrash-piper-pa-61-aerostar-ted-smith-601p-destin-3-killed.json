He was immediately cleared for a landing at Eglin AFB. While maneuvering for a landing the left engine and wing separated from the aircraft. The engine was separated from the wing and showed evidence of in flight fire. The most intense heat was in the engine accessory section in the area between the bendix fuel servo and the inboard turbocharger. There was extensive fire damage to the oil and fuel lines on the right side of the accessory section, the oil dipstick showed no oil and there was no evidence to show that the oil had spilled in the impact crater.
