This was the first of two trips to transport a family and their supplies to the lake. The mother and four children were being taken on this trip. The noise of the engine was heard and the aircraft disappeared round a point on what appeared to be a normal take off. Shortly after a loud noise like a twelve bore shotgun was heard by witnesses at the departure point. They went down the bay by boat to find a small portion of the tail and pieces of floats only, visible above the water. There were no survivors.\r\nSource: www.dhc-2.com", "probable_cause": null}
