In such situation, the captain decided to reduce his altitude and to attempt an emergency landing. The aircraft belly landed in an open field, slid for few dozen meters and came to rest in flames. All 27 occupants were able to evacuate the cabin and were uninjured. The aircraft was destroyed by fire.
