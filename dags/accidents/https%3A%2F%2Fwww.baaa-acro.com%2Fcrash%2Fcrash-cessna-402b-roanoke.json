The overheating was due to the engine air cooling baffle not being installed and the improper oil filter being installed. The airplane would not sustain flight due to the inoperative main landing gear which was locked in the down position and the propeller that could not feather due to corrosion. The pilot and his passenger were seriously injured in the landing due to the lack of seat belts. The airplane was operated with 137 known deficiencies.
