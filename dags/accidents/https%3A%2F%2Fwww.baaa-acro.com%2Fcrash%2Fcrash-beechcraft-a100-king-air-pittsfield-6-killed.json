With abyss inoperative, the minimum descent altitude (MDA) was 2200 feet. After N65TD was cleared for the approach, radar service was terminated and the flight was cleared to advisory frequency. The crew contacted unicom and obtained airport and weather advisory. The Unicom operator advised winds light and variable, estimated 800 feet overcast, visibility 5 miles, slush and ice reported on runway 1/2 hr earlier. After the crew reported 'procedure turn inbound,' no further transmissions were received from the aircraft. Subsequently, it hit trees on rising terrain at an elevation of approx 2200 feet, approx 7 miles before reaching the final approach fix (FAF, DALTON NDB). Minimum altitude for the approach in that area was 3000 feet. No preimpact part problems were found during the investigation. Airport elevation was 1194 feet. Radio transcripts indicated the crew were getting a weak signal from the DALTON NDB. Although not a required navaid, CHESTER VORTAC was depicted on the approach chart as an additional source to id the FAF, but was notamed as out-of-svc. The pilot did not obtain notams before flight.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with object\r\nPhase of operation: approach - iaf to faf/outer marker (ifr)\r\nFindings\r\n1.
