The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 59 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the loss of control was the consequence of an error on part of the flight mechanic who inadvertently positioned the flaps in an angle of 40\u00b0 while in cruising flight. This reduced the longitudinal stability and the control was rapidly lost. It was reported that the flap lever was not protected against accidental actuation which was considered as a contributing factor. "}
