During takeoff the pilot reported an opened door and requested to return to land. The aircraft turned left and descended to the ground. Examination of the aircraft did not disclose evidence of malfunction. Examination of the aircraft doors revealed the right side cargo door securing mechanisms were relatively undamaged. Flight test conducted to evaluate the effects of a opened door disclosed in part the following. The door will open and remain open during rotation; results in noise and vibration; no abnormal flight characteristics; no significant change in multi-engine climb performance. Pilot landing in jet aircraft prior to accident reported moderate turbulence with a plus or minus 10 to 15 knots change in airspeed from 2,000 feet msl to the surface. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: miscellaneous/other\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1. (f) door, cargo/baggage - fire\r\n2.
