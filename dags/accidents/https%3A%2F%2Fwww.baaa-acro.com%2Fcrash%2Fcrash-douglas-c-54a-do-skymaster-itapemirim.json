Due to poor visibility caused by thick fog, the crew failed to establish a visual contact with the airport of Rio and continued to the northeast. Eventually, the captain elected to make an emergency landing, maybe due to fuel shortage. The aircraft crash landed on a beach located in Itapemirim, about 330 km northeast of Rio. The aircraft was written off while all occupants were unhurt.", "probable_cause": null}
