Quickly on the scene, rescuers were able to evacuate all eight occupants injured while the aircraft was destroyed. Brand new, it was delivered to Northwest Airlines few weeks ago. ", "probable_cause": "It is the opinion of the Accident Board that the probable causes of this accident were: \r\n- Failure of the Supervisory Personnel to definitely determine the actual fuel consumption of a new airplane before placing it in scheduled operation,\r\n- Failure of the fuel gauge on the left tank to function accurately,\r\n- Pilot error for failing to attempt to use the right fuel tank after the instrument board warning light had indicated that the task which he was using was about empty. This was his first flight on this type of aircraft as well. At the time of the accident, the crew calculated that the fuel consumption was about 163 liters per hour while the real consumption was about 240 liters per hour. \n\n"}
