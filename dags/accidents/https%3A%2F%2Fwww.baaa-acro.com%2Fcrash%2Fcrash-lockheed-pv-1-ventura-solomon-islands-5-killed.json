While approaching the target, NZ4614 disappeared and apparently crashed into the Solomon Sea. The crew of both other aircraft started a SAR mission to find the wreckage but without success. All operations were eventually suspended on September 17 as no trace of the aircraft was found. As the Japanese forces evacuated the region in February 1944, it was concluded the crash was not caused by enemy action.\r\nCrew:\r\nF/Lt Roye Stevens, \r\nF/O John Carson, \r\nW/O Geoffrey Innes, \r\nP/O Stanley Dawson,\r\nF/O John McGuire.", "probable_cause": null}
