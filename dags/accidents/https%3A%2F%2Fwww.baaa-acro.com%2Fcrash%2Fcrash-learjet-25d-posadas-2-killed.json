As the aircraft was too high on the glide, the captain decided to abandon the approach and initiated a go-around. Few minutes later, he attempted to make a visual approach to runway 19. On final, the crew failed to realize his altitude was too low when the aircraft struck the water surface and crashed in the Paran\u00e1 River, few hundred meters offshore. Two passengers were killed while five other occupants were injured. Weather conditions were marginal at the time of the accident. ", "probable_cause": null}
