While flying in a narrow valley, the pilot elected to gain height when the aircraft hit trees and crashed in flames. The airplane was destroyed by a post crash fire and all three occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nF/O Sydney W. Peebles.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was caused by the inexperience of the pilot who has 6,000 flying hours but little Highlands experience and was restricted by Qantas to the Madang - Goroka route. He took the DCA charter against company regulations and flew the wrong way up a narrowing valley, attempting to out climb rising terrain while throwing passenger's baggage out to reduce the load."}
