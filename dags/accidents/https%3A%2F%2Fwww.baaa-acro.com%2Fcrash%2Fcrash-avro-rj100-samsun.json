While on a second approach to runway 03 which is 1,620 metres long, the aircraft was too high on the glide and landed about half way down the runway. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, it overran, lost its undercarriage and collided with an earth mound located 67 metres past the runway end. All 74 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew continued the approach above the glide with an excessive speed, causing the aircraft to land too far down the runway (about half way down), reducing the landing distance available. At the time of the accident, the runway was wet and the braking action was reduced. The crew failed to initiate a go-around procedure."}
