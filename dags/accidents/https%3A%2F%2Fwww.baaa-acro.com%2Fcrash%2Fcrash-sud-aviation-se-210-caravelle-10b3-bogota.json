During the takeoff roll, after V1 speed, one of the tyre burst. The captain continued and completed the rotation. During initial climb, he informed ATC about the situation and followed a holding circuit for about two hours to burn fuel. Following an unstable approach, the aircraft landed too far down the runway. As the captain realized he could not stop the aircraft within the remaining distance, he decided to retract the undercarriage. The aircraft slid on its belly, overran, went through a fence and eventually came to rest in a ravine located 100 metres further. All nine occupants escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. Fortunately, the dynamite did not explode.  ", "probable_cause": null}
