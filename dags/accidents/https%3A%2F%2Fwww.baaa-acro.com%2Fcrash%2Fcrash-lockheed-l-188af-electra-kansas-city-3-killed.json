On final approach, the aircraft was high and was not in a position to land, so the flight was cleared to circle left for another approach to land. The aircrew acknowledged and began circling left which took them in the vicinity of the Fairfax Airport. A short time later, the ATC controller cautioned that the flight might be lining up for the Fairfax Airport. Subsequently, the crew initiated a missed approach and were instructed to turn to 360\u00b0 and climb to 3,000 feet. The aircraft began a steep climb to 3,100 feet, stalled and entered a steep descent. Before the descent was arrested, the aircraft impacted in a public water treatment plant. CVR recordings indicated that the 1st officer was flying the aircraft during the en route descent, VOR approach and circling approach, then the captain took control during the missed approach. An exam of the wreckage revealed no evidence of an airframe or powerplant problem. Also, there was no evidence that the cargo had shifted. All three crew members were killed.
