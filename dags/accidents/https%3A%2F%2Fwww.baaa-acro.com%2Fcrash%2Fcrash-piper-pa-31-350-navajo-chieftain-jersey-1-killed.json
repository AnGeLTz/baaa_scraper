While approaching the Channel Islands, the pilot informed ATC about technical problems and elected to divert to Jersey Airport. Shortly later, after both engines stopped due to a fuel exhaustion, the plane lost height and crashed in the sea about 3 nm northwest of Jersey Island. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot was killed.", "probable_cause": "The following causal factors were identified:\r\n- The commander had not made an appropriate allowance for adverse headwind components before or during the flight.\r\n- The aircraft was not carrying sufficient fuel for the intended flight.\r\n- The commander apparently ignored pre-flight and in-flight indications that he should land and refuel in France.\r\n- The commander's chances of survival were adversely affected by not adopting the optimum configuration and heading for ditching.
