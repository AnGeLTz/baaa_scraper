After touchdown on wet runway 27, the crew started the braking procedure but the airplane was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran and eventually collided with several trees. All 16 occupants were rescued, two passengers were slightly injured. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "At the time of the accident, the runway surface was wet and the braking coefficient was reduced. It was determined that only the reverse system on engine n\u00b02 was activated. For undetermined reason, reversers on engines n\u00b01 and 3 were not deployed. In such conditions, braking action was poor. "}
