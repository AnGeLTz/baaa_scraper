Following a short circuit, he started a second attempt to land when, on short final, the airplane rolled to the left and descended to the ground, crashing near the runway threshold. The aircraft was destroyed and all four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control on short final following poor techniques on part of the pilot-in-command. The low visibility caused by snow falls was considered as a contributing factor as well as the fact that the speed indicator was probably showing erroneous parameters because the receptor was obstructed by snow. This situation reduced the aircraft' speed on final, causing a stall. "}
