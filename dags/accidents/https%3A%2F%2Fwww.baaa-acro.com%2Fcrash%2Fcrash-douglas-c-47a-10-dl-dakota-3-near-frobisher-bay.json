En route, the crew was informed that a landing in Frobisher Bay was not possible due to the deterioration of the weather conditions. The crew apparently decided to divert to another aircraft but few dozen minutes later, while cruising at an altitude of 9,000 feet, the captain informed ATC that he was low of fuel and should land. He eventually completed a belly landing in an open land located about 80 km north of Frobisher Bay. All 26 occupants were rescued and the airplane, damaged beyond repair, was abandoned on site.
