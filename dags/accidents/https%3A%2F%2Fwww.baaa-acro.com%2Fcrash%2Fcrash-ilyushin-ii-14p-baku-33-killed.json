In such conditions, the captain decided to return to Baku-Bina Airport but due to poor visibility, he was unable to locate the airfield. Five minutes later, both engines temperature dropped and four minutes later, out of control, the airplane crashed into the sea off Baku. SAR operations were quickly conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the 33 occupants was found.
