Enroute, weather conditions worsened and the crew was instructed to divert to RAF Syerston. Few minutes later, the pilot encountered technical problems with the left engine that was shot down and its propeller feathered. On final approach to RAF Syerston, the pilot was forced to make a go around for unknown reason. During its second attempt to land, the aircraft was seen to fly over the airbase at low height with its landing gear down. Suddenly, it bank left and crashed in a field located two miles from the airbase. The aircraft was destroyed and all four crew members were killed. \r\nCrew (201st Advanced Flying School):\r\nSgt G.
