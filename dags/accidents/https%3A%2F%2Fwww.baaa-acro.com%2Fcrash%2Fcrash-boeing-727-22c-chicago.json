The takeoff was continued as the crew tried to figure out what caused the warning. The horn ceased prior to reaching rotate speed. The stick shaker came on and thrust was added, but the aircraft failed to climb and the captain elected to discontinue the takeoff. The 727 settled back to the macadam shoulder off the right side of the runway and struck a ditch, coming to rest 1,100 feet beyond the runway end and 300 feet right of the extended centreline. The aircraft was destroyed by a post crash fire and all three crew members were injured. The flaps had been set at 2\u00b0 instead of takeoff range of 5\u00b0-25\u00b0.", "probable_cause": "The failure of the crew to abort the takeoff after being warned of an unsafe takeoff condition."}
