Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran, lost its undercarriage and came to rest in flames few dozen meters further. All 58 occupants were able to evacuate the cabin and five of them were injured. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flight crew who continued the descent while the aircraft was too high on the glide and unstable with an excessive approach speed. This caused the airplane to land too far down (848 meters past the threshold) a wet runway contaminated by heavy rain falls. In such conditions, the airplane was unable to stop within the remaining distance and overran at a speed of 80 knots. Because the aircraft was unstable and the approach configuration was wrong, the crew should initiate a go-around maneuver. "}
