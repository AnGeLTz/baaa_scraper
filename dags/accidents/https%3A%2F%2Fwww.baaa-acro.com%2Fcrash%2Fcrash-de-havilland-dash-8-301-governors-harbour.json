", "probable_cause": "The probable Cause has been determined as an over-center Torque Link condition that culminated in a single cycle failure of the cylinder. The over center torque links condition occur as a result of the over extension of the shock strut.\r\nPossible Contributory factors to the over extension of the shock strut includes:\r\nPossible Cause for Loss of Damping\r\n\u2022 The failure to install the dampening ring when the landing gear was assembled.\r\n\u2022 Improper servicing of the landing gear shock strut with Mil-H-5606 hydraulic fluid plus nitrogen during initial assembly.\r\n\u2022 Improper servicing of landing gear shock strut during line maintenance and inadequate post servicing follow up per AMM Chapter 12.
