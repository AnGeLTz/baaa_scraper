The crew was cleared to return for an approach to runway 09 and initiated a circuit. On final approach, at a height of 300 feet, the airplane entered a nose down angle of 45\u00b0 then crashed in a huge explosion about one km short of runway 09. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 95 occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the 10th stage of the compressor disc, probably after a blade failed due to fatigue cracks. Debris sectioned fuel and hydraulic lines, causing the fluid to leak in the engine and to ignite while in contact with high temperature elements. The fire quickly spread as the crew failed to shut off the fuel supply system. "}
