With a wind of 16 knots from 159\u00b0, the runway in use was 139\u00b0. Cross wind was apparently not corrected for and the plane drifted toward the left side of the runway as it continued the takeoff run. Slightly before becoming airborne, the port wing tip struck a fifteen foot vertical embankment on the left side of the runway. The outer eight feet of the port wing folded back, the plane climbed the embankment and cart wheeled over onto its back. Three bombs were thrown clear. The fourth remained in the wreckage, but did not explode. The aircraft was totally destroyed and five crewmen were killed while three others were injured. \r\nCrew:\r\nLt Walter M.
