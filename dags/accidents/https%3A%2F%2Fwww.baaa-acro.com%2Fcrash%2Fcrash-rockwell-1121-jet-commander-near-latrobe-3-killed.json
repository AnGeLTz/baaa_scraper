Ice detection system had been intermittently inoperative. The aircraft entered holding in icing conditions while checking flight inspection equipment. Evidence indicated crew noted ice accretion, activated surface de-ice system, ice broke loose and entered engine intakes. Both engines flamed out. During emergency descent crew initially re-starts, but neither engine would sustain power. Crew requested vectors to more distant airport. Both pilots were seen drinking previous night. Copilot had recently lost drivers license for dui. Captain had decided to retire that day. Copilot had worked in flight ops 3 days in 8 weeks and had limited training in flight inspection. Both pilots had personal stresses which may have influenced performance. Captain's contaminated thoracic blood revealed 0.057% alcohol. Putrefaction would accentuated for part of alcohol level. Copilot had trace alcohol in urine only. Both engines showed compressor fod consistent with ice ingestion. No other aircraft system or engine malfunction found.
