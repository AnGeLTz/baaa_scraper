On approach with flaps down at 15-20\u00b0, the airplane landed at high speed. Upon touchdown, the right rear tyre located on the left main gear burst. Debris punctured a hydraulic line, causing the landing gear to be partially retracted. A fire erupted in the wheel well and the airplane came to rest on runway. All occupants were evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Four landings at high speed were completed, causing some tyres to be damaged.
