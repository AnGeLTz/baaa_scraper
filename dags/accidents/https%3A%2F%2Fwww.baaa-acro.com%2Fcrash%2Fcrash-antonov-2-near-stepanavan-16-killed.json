Both pilots and a passenger were injured while all 16 other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a poor flight preparation on part of the flying crew and operations of the company, which resulted in the violation of the published procedures as the crew decided to fly in the clouds without any visual references with the ground. Information related to weather conditions and transmitted to the crew did not reflect the truth, which was considered as a contributing factor. It was also reported there were 12 adults and 5 children (aged 3 months to 5 years) on board, which does not comply with the published procedures as the aircraft is certified for 12 passengers only (adults and/or children)."}
