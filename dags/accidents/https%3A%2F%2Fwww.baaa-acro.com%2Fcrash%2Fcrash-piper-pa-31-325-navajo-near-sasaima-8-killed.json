The flight was completed at an altitude of 15,000 feet and the crew was eventually cleared to start the descent to Bogot\u00e1 for an approach to runway 13R. Shortly later, the aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a wooded area located near Sasaima, about 42 km northwest of Bogot\u00e1 Airport. The aircraft was totally destroyed upon impact and all eight occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the loss of control was the consequence of a double engine failure in flight due to a fuel exhaustion. At the time of the accident, all tanks were empty and the crew failed to calculate properly the fuel consumption, and the fuel quantity for the last leg from Pereira to Bogot\u00e1 was insufficient. The aircraft was completing a series of flight since Octobre 26."}
