Decision was taken by the French Army to proceed to repairs at Flores and a second Transall was dispatched on May 23. On touchdown, the C-160 Transall registered 61-MI (F-14) went out of control, veered off runway and came to rest in flames. All five crew members were able to evacuate the cabin before the aircraft would be destroyed by fire. The first Transall (F-12) was eventually repaired in July and returned into service.
