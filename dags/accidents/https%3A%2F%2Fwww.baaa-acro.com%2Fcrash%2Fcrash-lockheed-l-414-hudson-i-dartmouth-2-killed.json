After takeoff, at a height of 100 feet, the right engine cut out and the airplane crashed into water off the McNabs Island, about five miles southwest of the airbase. Both crew members were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nF/O J. J. Lalonde, pilot, \r\nCpl M. J. Armitage, navigator.", "probable_cause": "Failure of the main fuel line on lower left hand side of the right engine. Failure of the left engine due to wrong manipulation of the fuel selector valve. The pilot or crewman turned the engine fuel selector valve to the 'right engine ON' position, thereby cutting off the fuel supply to the good motor (left) and diverting it to the dead motor. This caused the good motor (left) to fail also. "}
