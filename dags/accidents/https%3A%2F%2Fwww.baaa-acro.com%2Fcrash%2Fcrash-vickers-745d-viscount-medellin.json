The aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent but the crew was able to regain control at an altitude of 4,000. The pilot declared an emergency and was cleared to divert to Medell\u00edn-Jos\u00e9 Maria Cordova Airport where the aircraft landed safely. Both pilots escaped with minor injuries while the aircraft was written off. Post accident inspection showed substantial airframe damage including a crack in the lower main spar boom extending across 35% of its chord. It is believed that the initial damage had been caused by a landing gear collapse 14 February 1988 which was then exacerbated by the loss of control during the turbulence on this flight.", "probable_cause": null}
