Shortly after takeoff, while climbing, the engine number one developed trouble and the aircraft was too heavy to return immediately to Kadena for a safe landing. The crew decided to jettison some of the bombs stored in the bomb bay to light the aircraft. Although the bombs were dropped in a safe condition, some of them exploded while impacting the sea. Fragments severely damaged the airplane to the extent that it was necessary to ditch in the sea about five miles from the end of the runway. Eight crew members were killed while three others were injured.", "probable_cause": "Failure of the engine number one. "}
