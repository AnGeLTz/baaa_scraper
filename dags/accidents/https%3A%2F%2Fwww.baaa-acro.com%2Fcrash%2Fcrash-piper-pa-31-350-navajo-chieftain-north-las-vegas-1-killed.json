A witness saw the aircraft departing at about 0250 pdt. Subsequently, it crashed approximately 3 miles east-northeast of the airport in an open undeveloped area. The time of the accident was not determined, but a clock in the wreckage had stopped at 0355. There was evidence the aircraft had impacted in a nose down, inverted attitude while on a north-northeast heading. The aircraft moved only 28 feet after impact and came to rest inverted with the gear extended and the flaps retracted. No preimpact mechanical problem was found. Toxicology tests showed the pilot had a blood/alcohol level of 3,7\u2030 and a vitreous/alcohol level of 3,3\u2030. No record was found to indicate that he had engaged in any previous formal flight training. There was evidence the pilot had been under recent stress. A friend reported the pilot and his wife were 'breaking up.' The pilot's wife reported he had a drinking problem which was the reason for their separation.
