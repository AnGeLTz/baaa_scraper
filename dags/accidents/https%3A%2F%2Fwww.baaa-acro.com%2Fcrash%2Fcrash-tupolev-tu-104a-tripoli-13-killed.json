Unable to establish a visual contact with the runway, the captain decided to make a go-around. Few minutes later, a second attempt to land on runway 18 was also abandoned for the same reason. In such conditions, the crew decided to change the circuit and initiated an approach from the south to runway 36. At a speed of 350 km/h, the airplane struck the ground and crashed in flames about 5,5 km short of runway threshold. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 13 occupants were killed.
