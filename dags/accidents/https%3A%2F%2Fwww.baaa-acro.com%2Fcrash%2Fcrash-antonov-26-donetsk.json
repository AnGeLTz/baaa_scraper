The approach was completed by night and limited visibility due to thunderstorm activity and heavy rain falls. On final, the crew failed to realize the aircraft was not properly aligned and continued the approach when the aircraft landed hard 80 metres to the left of the runway. Out of control, it rolled for few dozen metres and eventually collided with a building. The aircraft was destroyed and all five occupants were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "Poor approach planning and landing configuration on part of the crew. The aircraft was not properly aligned and its rate of descent was excessive during the last segment.
