The captain overcorrected, causing the airplane to adopt a high sink rate. In a nose-down attitude, the nose gear struck a concrete wall located 12 meters short of runway threshold and was torn off. The airplane landed on its nose and slid for about 300 meters before coming to rest. All three crew members escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the pilot-in-command. "}
