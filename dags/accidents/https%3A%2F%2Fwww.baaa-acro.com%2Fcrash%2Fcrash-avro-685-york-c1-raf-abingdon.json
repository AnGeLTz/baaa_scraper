As the aircraft was unstable on approach, the captain decided to make a go around when the engine number four overheat. Simultaneously, the approach light system failed. In dark, the crew decided to land immediately, raised the undercarriage and crash landed in a field short of runway threshold. While all five crew members were unhurt, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the number three engine overheat was attributed to the failure of the thermostatic valve. The reason of the temperature raise on the engine number four was attributed to the same reason, but this time, the failure of the thermostatic valve was caused by a faulty assembly on part of the manufacturer. The cause of the failure on the approach light system remains unknown. "}
