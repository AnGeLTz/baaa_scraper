The following contributing factors were reported: \r\n- The aircraft' speed at touchdown was excessive,\r\n- As the aircraft was too high on approach, it landed too far down the runway, approximately a third past the runway threshold,\r\n- The crew failed to initiate a go-around maneuver, \r\n- Poor crew coordination.
