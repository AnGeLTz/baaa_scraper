The captain decided to make an emergency landing and attempted to ditch the aircraft into the Gullmarsfjorden (Lake Gullmar) located some 15 km west of Uddevalla. By night, the crew was able to land on the lake and the aircraft slid for several yards before coming to rest. All ten occupants took refuge in a dinghy and were later rescued. The aircraft sunk and was lost. ", "probable_cause": "Left engine failure and right engine fire. "}
