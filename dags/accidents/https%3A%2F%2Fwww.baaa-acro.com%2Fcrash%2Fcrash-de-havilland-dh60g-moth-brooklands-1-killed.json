The pilot was killed and the female passenger was injured. \r\nCrew:\r\nJames Skipworth Wilkinson.\r\nPassenger: \r\nMargaret Maffett.", "probable_cause": "It was explained that the machine was a dual control 'plane, and that it crashed after entering a spin. It was rule of the club that when a pilot took up an unqualified passenger the controls should be disconnected. An Air Ministry inspector told how he found marks and paint on one of the girl's shoes, from which it was obvious that she put her foot on the rudder bar pedal. His theory was that at some time during the spin she unwittingly put her foot down, and this would obstruct the pilot's recovery."}
