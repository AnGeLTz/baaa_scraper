Following several uneventful manoeuvres, the crew completed a new approach for landing when, on short final, the airplane sank and stuck the runway surface at a speed of 140 knots. On impact, the left main gear was sheared off and the airplane went out of control and veered off runway to the left. While contacting soft ground, the left wing was torn off and the aircraft came to rest in flames. All six occupants were evacuated safely while the aircraft was destroyed.
