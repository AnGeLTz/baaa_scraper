Approaching the London area, the crew encountered poor weather conditions and low visibility. At 1925LT, the radio operator informed ground that he was lost and, while cruising at an altitude of 10,000 feet, was unable to locate the aerodromes of Hawkinge, Lympne or Detling. Thus, the crew decided to leave the area and continued to the east to reach an airport out of the London area. While approaching Ipswich, the aircraft was mistakenly shot down by a British antiaircraft battery and crashed into the sea few hundred yards off Orford. All four crew members were killed.
