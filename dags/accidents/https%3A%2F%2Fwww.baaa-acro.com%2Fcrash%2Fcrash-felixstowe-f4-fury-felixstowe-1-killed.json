A last local test flight was scheduled out from Felixstowe with seven crew members on board. Shortly after takeoff, while climbing at a speed of 145 km/h, the aircraft stalled and crashed in the sea some 500 metres offshore. Six crew members were rescued while the seventh was killed. The aircraft was supposed to leave Felixstowe on August 12 on a trip to Durban via Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, Khartoum, Victoria Nyanza, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Nyassa and Beira.\r\nCrew: \r\nCol T.

Major Moon at the controls apparently left the water before the safe flying speed and with insufficient power left to draw on, the aircraft stalled."}
