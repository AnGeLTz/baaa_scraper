After a takeoff run of about 600 meters, the pilot-in-command completed the rotation and the aircraft climbed to a height of 30-40 meters when it banked right to an angle of 10-15\u00b0 then up to 70\u00b0. Out of control, it plunged into the earth and crashed in a huge explosion in a field located 922 meters to the right of the extended center line, about 800 meters past the runway end.
