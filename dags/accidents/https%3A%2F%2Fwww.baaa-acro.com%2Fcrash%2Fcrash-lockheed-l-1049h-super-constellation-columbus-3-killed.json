After takeoff, during initial climb, the airplane encountered difficulties to gain height, struck power cables, stalled and crashed in flames in a soybean field. Both pilots and a passenger were killed while five other occupants were injured. The aircraft was totally destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "The flight crew's inadequate and uncoordinated response to the No 2 engine fire warning. The flight engineer failed to correct a gradual power decay on the other engines which occurred while he was retarding the No 2 engine throttle, and the power decay went uncorrected by the pilot and co-pilot. The lack of co-ordination and the lack of corrective action may have been caused by the lack of recent flight crew experience in the L-1049 aircraft. Contributing to the accident was the aircraft's over maximum take-off weight, the crew's use of less than full power for take-off, and the use of less than take-off cowl flaps which precluded adequate engine cooling."}
