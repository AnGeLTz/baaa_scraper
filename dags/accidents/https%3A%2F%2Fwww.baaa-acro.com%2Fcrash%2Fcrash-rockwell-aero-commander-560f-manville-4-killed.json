The pilot reported entering what his stormscope showed as a 'clear' area after encountering rain and moderate turbulence at temperatures conducive to structural icing. The controller noted a 1,000 foot loss of altitude from the assigned cruise altitude of 17,000 feet, followed by a loss of altitude readout. Shortly thereafter the aircraft disappeared from the controller's radar scope. The wreckage was found near the last radar fix. The airplane impacted in a near vertical descent. All four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "A loss of control following flight into weather conditions containing thunderstorms, turbulence and icing conditions. Factors were: inaccurate weather evaluation and flight into known adverse weather by the pilot in command."}
