Few debris were found floating on water about 60 miles southwest of San Diego and all 27 crew members were missing and never recovered.", "probable_cause": "Due to lack of evidences, the exact cause of the collision could not be determined with certainty. However, it was reported that both crews were dispatched to perform this mission while they were tired due to a long period of duty. At the time of the accident, weather conditions were marginal as partly cloudy at 2,000 feet over water, local thunderstorm activity and rain showers. Both crews committed negligences while cruising in formation and failed to pay attention to the exact position of the second aircraft. Also, it was reported that the crew of 159325 failed to follow the assigned heading for unknown reasons. "}
