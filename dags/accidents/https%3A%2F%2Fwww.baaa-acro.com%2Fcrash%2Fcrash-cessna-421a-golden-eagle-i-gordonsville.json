The pilot reported the aircraft accelerated normally to V1 speed; however, it hit the tops of trees about 350 to 500 feet beyond the runway, then struck the ground after traveling about another 1,000 feet. Performance charts showed the aircraft would have needed a takeoff distance of 2,200 feet to clear a 50 feet obstacle in calm wind. The pilot reported the wind was from 010\u00b0 at 3 to 5 knots. A witness reported a 3 to 5 knot tailwind. No preimpact part failure or malfunction was found.
