Lacey", "flight_phase": "Flight", "flight_type": "Demonstration", "survivors": "No", "site": "Lake, Sea, Ocean, River", "schedule": "Santa Rosa - Santa Rosa", "msn": "15-1605", "yom": 1945, "flight_number": null, "city": "Lakeport", "zone": "California", "country": "United States of America", "region": "North America", "crew_on_board": 1, "crew_fatalities": 1, "pax_on_board": 7, "pax_fatalities": 7, "other_fatalities": 0, "total_fatalities": 8, "captain_hours": 811, "captain_hours_type": null, "copilot_hours": null, "copilot_hours_type": null, "aircraft_hours": null, "circumstances": "The airplane was observed making several low passes, with its smoke generators operating, over seaplanes anchored in a lake. The last pass was reportedly at an altitude less than 50 feet, and then the airplane was observed entering an abnormally steep climb, followed by a near vertical nose-down attitude to impact. A video tape shows that both propellers were turning. The pilot had received his multi-engine rating in a Beech 76 on 3/6/90, and his type rating in the airplane 3/28/90.", "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command's failure to maintain airspeed during a pull-up from a low pass. Factors which contributed to the accident were: the pilot's poor judgement in buzzing the seaplanes which resulted in insufficient altitude to recover from the stall, and the pilot's inexperience in the airplane."}
