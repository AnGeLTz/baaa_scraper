During takeoff from runway 11 at Sitka, he provided a pirep to the flight service station, saying that he had entered the cloud bases at 700 feet msl. While departing, a left turn was made, and the airplane crashed on Mt Verstovia at the 1420 feet level, approximately 3 miles east of the airport. An on-scene investigation revealed the airplane struck wooded terrain while climbing on a heading of 359\u00b0. Several tree limbs had been clean cut (by the propellers); wreckage was spread over a 516 feet area. A standard instrument departure (Sitka 5 sid) was available which would have provided terrain clearance with a right turn-out from runway 11 to an initial climb heading of 280\u00b0.", "probable_cause": "Improper planning/decision by the pilot, and his failure to follow IFR procedures and maintain clearance from mountainous terrain."}
