The first officer was killed, and the captain received minor injuries. The airplane was destroyed by impact forces. The flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 121 as a cargo flight for DHL Express from Memphis International Airport (MEM), Memphis, Tennessee, to CVG. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on an instrument flight rules flight plan. The flight crew was scheduled to fly the accident airplane on a roundtrip sequence from MEM to CVG. Flight 185 departed MEM about 2329. The first officer was the flying pilot, and the captain performed the non flying pilot duties. During postaccident interviews, the captain stated that the takeoff and climb portions of the flight were normal. According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, at 0017:49, the captain stated that he was just going to \u201cbalance out the fuel here.\u201d The first officer acknowledged. From 0026:30 to 0027:08, the CVR recorded the captain discussing the airplane\u2019s weight and balance with the first officer. Specifically, the captain stated, \u201ccouldn\u2019t figure out why on the landing I was out and I was okay on the takeoff.\u201d The captain added, \u201cthe momentum is one six six seven and I\u2026put one zero six seven and I couldn\u2019t work it.\u201d He then stated, \u201cso\u2026we were okay all along.\u201d At 0030:40, the first officer stated, \u201cweird.\u201d At 0032:31, the captain stated, \u201cokay just let me finish this [the weight and balance paperwork] off and\u2026I\u2019m happy,\u201d and, about 2 minutes later, he stated, \u201cokay, back with you here.\u201d At 0037:08, the captain contacted Cincinnati Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) and reported an altitude of 11,000 feet mean sea level. About 1 minute later, the first officer stated, \u201csomething\u2019s messed up with this thing,\u201d and, at 0039:07, he asked \u201cwhy is this thing?\u201d At 0041:21, the first officer stated that the control wheel felt \u201cfunny.\u201d He added, \u201cfeels like I need a lot of force. it is pushing to the right for some reason. I don\u2019t know why\u2026I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d The first officer then repeated twice that it felt like he needed \u201ca lot of force.\u201d The CVR did not record the captain responding to any of these comments. At 0043:53, when the airplane was at an altitude of about 4,000 feet, the captain reported to Cincinnati TRACON that he had the runway in sight. The approach controller cleared flight 185 for a visual approach to runway 36R and added, \u201ckeep your speed up.\u201d The captain acknowledged the clearance and the instruction. The first officer then stated, \u201cwhat in the world is going on with this plane? sucker is acting so funny.\u201d The captain replied, \u201cwe\u2019ll do a full control check on the ground.\u201d At 0044:43, the approach controller again told the captain to \u201ckeep your speed up\u201d and instructed him to contact the CVG Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). At 0045:11, the captain contacted the CVG ATCT and requested clearance to land on runway 36R, and the local control west controller issued the landing clearance. Flight data recorder (FDR) data indicated that, shortly afterward, the airplane passed through about 3,200 feet, and its airspeed began to decrease from about 240 knots indicated airspeed. At 0045:37, when the airplane was at an altitude of about 3,000 feet, the captain started the in-range checklist,  stating, \u201cbypass is down. hydraulic pressure. quantity checks. AC [alternating current] pump is on. green light. fuel panel. boost pumps on.\u201d About 0046, the first officer stated, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, what is wrong with this plane? it is really funny. I got something all messed up here.\u201d The captain replied, \u201cyeah.\u201d The first officer then asked, \u201ccan you feel it? it\u2019s like swinging back and forth.\u201d The captain replied, \u201cwe\u2019ve got an imbalance on this\u2026crossfeed I left open.\u201d The first officer responded, \u201coh, is that what it is?\u201d A few seconds later, the first officer stated, \u201cwe\u2019re gonna flame out.\u201d The captain responded, \u201cI got the crossfeed open. just keep power on.\u201d At 0046:45, the CVR recorded a sound similar to decreasing engine rpm. Immediately thereafter, the first officer stated, \u201cwe\u2019re losing power.\u201d At 0046:52, the first officer stated, \u201cwe\u2019ve lost both of them. did we?\u201d The captain responded, \u201cnope.\u201d FDR data showed that, about 1 second later, a momentary electrical power interruption occurred when the airplane was at an altitude of about 2,400 feet. At 0046:55, the CVR stopped recording. Airplane performance calculations indicated that, shortly after the power interruption, the airplane\u2019s descent rate was about 900 feet per minute (fpm). According to air traffic control (ATC) transcripts, at 0047:12, the captain reported to the CVG ATCT that the airplane was \u201chaving engine problems.\u201d The local control west controller asked, \u201cyou\u2019re having engine problems?\u201d The captain replied, \u201caffirmative.\u201d At 0047:28, the controller asked the captain if he needed emergency equipment, and the captain replied, \u201cnegative.\u2019\u201d This was the last transmission received by ATC from the accident flight crew. The FDR continued recording until about 0049. The wreckage was located about 1.2 miles short of runway 36R.", "probable_cause": "Fuel starvation resulting from the captain\u2019s decision not to follow approved fuel crossfeed procedures. Contributing to the accident were the captain's inadequate preflight planning, his subsequent distraction during the flight, and his late initiation of the in-range checklist. Further contributing to the accident was the flight crew\u2019s failure to monitor the fuel gauges and to recognize that the airplane\u2019s changing handling characteristics were caused by a fuel imbalance."}
