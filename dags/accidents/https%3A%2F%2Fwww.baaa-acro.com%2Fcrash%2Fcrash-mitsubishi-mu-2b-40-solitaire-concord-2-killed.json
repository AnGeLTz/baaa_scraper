A witness, who heard the airplane overhead, reported that it sounded low and at least one engine was operating. He reported that when he looked up, the airplane was in a dive, spinning slowly; however, the airplane did not make a complete revolution. Radar data showed the airplane in a left descending turn at approximately 2000 feet per minute. The airplane impacted the ground about 3 miles west of the airport in a near vertical descent, and much of the forward section had penetrated the ground. There was a post-crash fire. Examination of the airplane and various actuators confirmed that the landing gear was retracted, flaps were extended 5\u00b0, elevator and aileron trim were neutral, and the rudder was positioned 3\u00b0 left. Examination of the engine confirmed internal/rotational damage. Both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control during flight for undetermined reason(s)."}
