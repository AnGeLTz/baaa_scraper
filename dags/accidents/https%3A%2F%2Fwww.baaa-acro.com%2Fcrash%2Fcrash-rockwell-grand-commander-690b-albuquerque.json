Pilot said he brought props into reverse and aircraft went off right side of runway. Pilot brought props out of reverse, realigned aircraft on runway, and reversed props again. Aircraft went off right side of runway and collided with runway lights and culverts. Right main and nose landing gears collapsed. Witnesses said approach was too fast with high sink rate that was arrested in landing flare. Pilot said he did not think there had been any mechanical failure or malfunction, but later wrote he thought left prop failed to reverse. Examination of aircraft revealed both prop blade tips curled opposite direction of rotation about 6 inches from tip.
