On approach at 3,000 feet, the aircraft' speed and height dropped. It entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a wooded area located in Dampierre-en-Yvelines, about 10 km from the runway 07L threshold. All three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The loss of control is probably the consequence of a rapid icing of the airframe insufficiently or belatedly taken into account by the pilot. The following factors may have contributed to the accident:\r\n- The pilot's fatigue generated by a flight period of 8 hours and 30 minutes in a single pilot configuration, \r\n- The single pilot configuration imposes a high workload during a VOR-DME approach.
