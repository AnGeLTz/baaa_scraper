After touchdown, the airplane suffered an asymmetrical thrust reversal. Due to high pressure, the nose gear collapsed and the airplane slid on runway for several yards before coming to rest. All 45 occupants were evacuated safely while the aircraft was considered as damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Improper operation of powerplant & powerplant controls on part of the pilot-in-command and the thrust reversal-asymmetrical was considered as a miscellaneous act. \r\nThe following factors were considered as contributing:\r\n- Failure of the pilot-in-command to initiate a go-around,\r\n- Low ceiling,\r\n- Rain,\r\n- Poorly planned approach,\r\n- Overload failure."}
