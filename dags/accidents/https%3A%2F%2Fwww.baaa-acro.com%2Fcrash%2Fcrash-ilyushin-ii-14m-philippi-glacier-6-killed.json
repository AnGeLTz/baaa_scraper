This caused the speed to drop and the fuel consumption to increase. Due to fuel shortage, the crew attempted an emergency landing on the Philippi Glacier located 240 km west of the Mirny Ice Station (at S66.833 E88.00). But in whiteout conditions, the aircraft crashed into the surface of the glacier and was completely destroyed. All six occupants were killed. The wreckage was found few days later. \n", "probable_cause": "Fuel exhaustion due to strong headwind and emergency landing in whiteout conditions. "}
