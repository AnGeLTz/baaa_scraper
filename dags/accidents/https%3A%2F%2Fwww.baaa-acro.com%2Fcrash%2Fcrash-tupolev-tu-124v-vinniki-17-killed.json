The airplane went out of control and crashed in a huge explosion in Vinniki, about 12 km east of the airfield. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 17 occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that a turbine blade located on the 1st stage of the high pressure turbine of the left engine broke off shortly after rotation, due to conception failure. Analyses revealed that the turbine blade that failed had not been the subject of a standard thermic treatment, which had the effect of reducing its resistance and its hardness that was lower than the requirements of the technical specifications. Investigators stated that the turbine blade failure caused a sudden loss of power of the left engine and several debris smashed in the turbine chamber, resulting in the rupture of a fuel line. Under pressure, the fuel leaked into the chamber and ignited while contacting various elements whose temperature was high. Under such circumstances, the flight crew was unable to maintain an adequate control of the aircraft."}
