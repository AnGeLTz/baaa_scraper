It had departed Athens at 1407Z on an IFR flight plan and later reported that it expected to fly over Caraffa at 1730 and requested clearance to fly at a lower level. This clearance was not granted since the flight level requested was below the safety minimum for that route segment. There were no further contacts with the aircraft. It crashed between 1735Z and 1808Z on the southeast slope of Mt Scifarello at a height of approximately 1,730 metres (5 675 ft). The 3 crew aboard were killed and the aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by a navigational error.
