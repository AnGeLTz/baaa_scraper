Upon approaching the pass the pilot encountered clouds which prevented his transit. The pilot then executed a 180\u00b0 right course reversal and at some point near the completion of the maneuver and in close proximity to the steep terrain along the western edge of the pass the pilot allowed the aircraft to enter a stall condition. The aircraft impacted the 40\u00b0 sloped terrain in a steep nose down, near wings level attitude and with a steep flight path. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
