They made an NDB approach, but missed the approach and requested another approach. Approximately one minute later, the crew reported the aircraft had accumulated a heavy load of ice. They could have diverted nearby to Kenai for an ILS approach, but elected to make a VOR approach back to Soldotna. While being vectored, they made two more checks with the weather observer who advised the weather had deteriorated to below minimums and recommended diverting, but the crew did not acknowledge. Subsequently, the aircraft collided with trees on high terrain approximately 1.5 mile southeast of the airport. There was evidence the aircraft was circling when it crashed. Circling was not authorized south of runway 07/25. Investigations revealed recurring problems with the anti-ice system, its 'single' mode was inoperative, two de-ice boots were missing from prop blades. Weather station listed only one lighted marker (1/4 mile away) for visibility reference; minimum landing visibility was one mile; ceilometer was inoperative. No FAA inspection of weather station in 2 years. Icing forecasted. All nine occupants were killed.
