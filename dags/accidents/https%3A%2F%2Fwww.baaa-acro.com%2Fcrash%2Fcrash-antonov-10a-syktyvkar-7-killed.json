During the final approach completed by night, the engines number 1, 2 & 3 flamed out in clouds and icing conditions. The crew was unable to feather the propeller that went in auto-rotation. Due to drag, the aircraft lost speed and height, banked left to an angle of 90\u00b0, struck tree tops and crashed in a wooded area located in Verkhnyaya Maksakovka, 10,2 km east of the Syktyvkar Airport. All 7 crew members were killed.", "probable_cause": "The engine flame out was probably caused by the air intake iced up. The crew inexperience and the poor efficiency of the air-intake heating system were considered as contributing factors. "}
