On final approach by night, the captain realized his altitude was insufficient and decided to initiate a go-around. He increased power on both engines but followed a wrong path with an insufficient rate of climb. At a speed of 232 km/h, the airplane struck tree tops, stalled and crashed 310 meters further on the slope of a wooded hill (410 meters high) located about 1,700 meters past the end of runway 06. A crew member and three passengers were killed while eight other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "The captain failed to follow the published procedures related to a go-around maneuver with a too low rate of climb and a wrong path. A poor flight preparation was considered as a contributing factor as well as the fact that the captain was flying to Bajkit for the first time. "}
