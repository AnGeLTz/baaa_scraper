The right engine fan rotor disc separated from the hub which damaged the cowling and some disc fragments buried in the fuselage but without damage to the flight controls. The drag created by the loss of thrust and the distorted cowling led to yaw and roll with loss of control of the aircraft. The fan failure propagated from a low grade fatigue crack on the high time fan which was not detected by the visual inspection procedures existing at the time. The manufacturer has since improved the manufacturing and inspection  techniques. An AD 86-04-02 was issued on 2/14/86 which deals with fan removal from service according to an operating cycle schedule.
