On final approach, at an altitude of 500 feet, the pilot-in-command deployed the flaps when the airplane stalled. He increased engine power but the airplane banked left, causing the left wingtip to hit the ground. Out of control, the aircraft crashed in a field short of runway. Two passengers, two young rugby players, were killed while 13 other occupants were injured at different degrees. The aircraft was destroyed. \r\nCrew:\r\nCharles D.
