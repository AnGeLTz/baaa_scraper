The aircraft departed Brussels at 1400LT bound to Paris. After passing Noyon, weather conditions worsened with a limited visibility due to foggy conditions. Unable to locate the airport of Paris-Le Bourget, the pilot continued to the south when he made a turn to the north. Eventually, he attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft impacted trees and crashed in a wooded area located near the Ch\u00e2teau de Champlatreux, south of Luzarches, some 15 km north of Le Bourget Airport. All three crew members were injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
