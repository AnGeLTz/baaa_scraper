The three engine aircraft was carrying three passengers, two pilots, 2,400 liters of gasoline, 180 liters of oil and 1,000 liters of liquid locust spray. After an uneventful first pass over the plantations, the pilot-in-command completed a circuit in an attempt to make a second low pass when, during a turn at low height, the left wing hit a tree. The aircraft stalled and crashed. Both pilots and two passengers were killed while the fifth occupants was injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The investigating authority attributed the accident to lack of technical experience on the part of the pilot in carrying out a spraying flight over mountainous terrain, resulting in his failure to allow adequate terrain clearance. Contributing factors were the type of operation, the nature of the area flown over and the type of aircraft used. "}
