While overflying the region of Gruyere, all 17 skydivers jumped. Few minutes later, while descending to Ecuvillens, the pilot encountered marginale weather conditions with limited visibility due to stratus up to the altitude of 1,060 metres. While flying under VFR mode in IMC conditions, the aircraft collided with trees and crashed the forest of Gibloux, near Pont-en-Ogoz. The aircraft was totally destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and both occupants, one pilot and one female passenger, were killed.
