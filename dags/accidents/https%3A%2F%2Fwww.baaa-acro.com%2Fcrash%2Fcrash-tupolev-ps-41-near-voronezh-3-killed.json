After flying a distance of about 350 km, while cruising at an altitude of 4,000 metres in clouds, the airplane entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a field at a speed of 750-800 km/h. All three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Due to the high degree of destruction, investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the accident.
