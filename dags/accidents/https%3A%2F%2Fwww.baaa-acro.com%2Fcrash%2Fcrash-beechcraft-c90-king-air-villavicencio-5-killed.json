Fifteen minutes into the flight, the crew contacted ATC, reported problems and was cleared to divert to Villavicencio. On approach to Villavicencio-La Vanguardia Airport, the aircraft stalled and crashed in a wooded area parallel to a road, bursting into flames. The aircraft was destroyed by a post crash fire and all five occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The following factors were identified:\r\n- The lack of technical knowledge published in the POH for the execution of the pertinent actions during the failure of the engine in flight, together with the unwise decisions made by the crew in that situation.\r\n- The haste of the crew members to land caused them to act in an uncoordinated manner and without the assertiveness required for the execution of the procedures contemplated by the manufacturer, the navigation charts and the published approach procedures.\r\n- The omissions, reactions and deviations inappropriate to conduct the flight safely to the runway.\r\n- The turning to the runway on the same side of the inoperative (critical) engine and maximum power on the operational engine during the unstabilized approach to the runway threshold which led to loss of control of the aircraft in low altitude flight."}
