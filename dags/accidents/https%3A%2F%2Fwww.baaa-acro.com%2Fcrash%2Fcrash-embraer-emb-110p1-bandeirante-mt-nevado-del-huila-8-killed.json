After departure, the crew was cleared to climb under VFR to the altitude of 14,500 feet. The last radio communication was recorded at 0940LT and three minutes later, while cruising in clouds at the altitude of 14,271 feet, the aircraft struck the slope of Mt Nevado del Huila (5,750 metres high). SAR operations were initiated but the wreckage was found 10 days later only, at an altitude of 4,350 metres. The aircraft was destroyed and all eight occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the accident due to lack of evidences. CVR, FDR, ATC communication and debris analysis failed to determine a possible cause to the accident. The following factors were reported: \r\n- The crew deviated from the planned route, \r\n- Reporting of inaccurate positions on the points that had projected in the Flight Plan,\r\n- Using a route on a flight level that requires the use of oxygen both for individuals and crews."}
