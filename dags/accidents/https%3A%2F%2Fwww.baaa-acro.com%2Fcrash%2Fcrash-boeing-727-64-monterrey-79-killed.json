In a visibility reduced by heavy rain falls, the crew initiated a turn to the left to intercept the glide. After passing over the Monterrey VOR, the aircraft descended with a rate of 1,500 feet per minute when, at a speed of 250 knots, it struck the slope of Cerro del Fraile located some 23 km from the airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 79 occupants were killed. The wreckage was found at an altitude of 1,800 meters few hours later. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew who initiated a turn to the left instead to the right as mentioned in the published procedures. At the time of the accident, the aircraft speed was too high, which was considered as a contributing factor. "}
