After liftoff, the aircraft banked right, causing the right wing tip to struck the runway surface. Out of control, the aircraft stalled and crashed 136 meters to the right of the runway. It broke in two and burst into flames. All four occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of a loss of control at rotation during a takeoff carried out according to an unsuitable procedure. The loss of control was caused by the huge drag created by the engine n\u00b04 propeller that was running in idle position, leading to a minimum air control speed greater than the takeoff speed. The progressive deterioration of the weather conditions preoccupied the crew and focused his attention, at the expense of the problem on engine n\u00b04. The decision to take off on three engines was announced during taxi only and the  improvised takeoff procedure was not analysed by the crew prior to departure. "}
