During the takeoff roll at Preveza-Aktion Airport, after V1 speed, the pilot-in-command heard a loud noise. Thinking this was the consequence of a bird strike, he decided to abandon the takeoff procedure and started an emergency braking manoeuvre. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, struck a dyke and came to rest partially submerged in the sea. All 16 occupants escaped uninjured.
