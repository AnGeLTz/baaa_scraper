After making a spray pass, he made a right 180-degree turn to an easterly heading and the right wing struck a radio tower. The pilot didn't know the extent of the damage and there appeared to be a \"controllability issue.\" He elected to land in a pasture. During the landing, the airplane struck and killed a cow and a bull, then collided with a pile of wood, resulting in substantial damage.

It was not marked on sectional charts.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to see and avoid the radio tower.\n"}
