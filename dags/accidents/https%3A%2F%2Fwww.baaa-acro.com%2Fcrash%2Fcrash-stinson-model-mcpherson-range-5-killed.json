Some 40 minutes after takeoff from Brisbane-Archerfield Airport, while cruising in marginal weather conditions over the McPherson Range, the aircraft hit tree tops and crashed in a dense wooded area. Both crewmen and two passengers were killed while three passengers survived. They walked away to find help but one of them (James Westray) died when he fall down a ravine. Eventually, on March 1st, 1937, the two last survivors (John Proud and Joseph Binstead) met Bernard O'Reilly, a bushman, and were rescued. \r\nCrew:\r\nRex Boyden, pilot, \u2020\r\nBeverley Shepherd, copilot. \u2020\r\nPassengers:\r\nR.
