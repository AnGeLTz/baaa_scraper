After crossing the last cloud layer, the twin engine was approaching runway 01 when, at an altitude of 100 feet, the aircraft banked right to an angle of 60\u00b0 then nosed down and crashed few km from the runway threshold, bursting into flames. The aircraft was totally destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and all 10 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Due to the total destruction of the aircraft by impact forces and fire, the exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, it is believed that icing conditions encountered from 3,000 to 5,000 feet may have affected the aircraft stability and controllability and thus, may be considered as a contributing factor. "}
