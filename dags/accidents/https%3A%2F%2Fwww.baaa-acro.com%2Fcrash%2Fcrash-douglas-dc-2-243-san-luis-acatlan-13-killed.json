Both pilots and eleven passengers were killed while eight other occupants were injured. It was determined that while approaching San Luis Acatl\u00e1n Airfield earlier that day, the crew spotted some cattle on the grassy runway and it took time for locals to remove all animals. Thus, the landing was delayed and when the crew started the takeoff run to Acapulco, it was already dark and the visibility was apparently insufficient. ", "probable_cause": null}
