Shortly after takeoff, the crew encountered difficulties to gain sufficient altitude and apparently attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft impacted a hill and eventually crashed into trees. The copilot and three passengers were killed and seven others occupants were injured, some seriously. The aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": "The following findings were identified:\r\n- Execution of a take-off with a weight approximately 17% higher than the maximum gross operating weight (MTOW) established for the C208B aircraft.\r\n- Limited climb rate with signs of lift loss due to the low performance given by the overweight during the initial climb phase.\r\n- Forced landing in mountainous terrain due to loss of lift caused by overweight during the initial climb.\r\n- Absence in the identification of the risks associated to an overweight operation of the aircraft.\r\n- Lack of supervision by the Aircraft Operator in relation to the dispatch of aircraft operating from the outside at the main base of operation."}
