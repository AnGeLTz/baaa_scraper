Witnesses heard the aircraft backfiring and the ground run was excessively long. Immediately after takeoff the aircraft went through the tops of pine trees. The backfiring and smoke stopped after the collision with the pine trees and the aircraft started a descent toward a street. It maneuvered as if to avoid a collision with cars. After the accident the spark plugs from the right engine were tested and all but #5 front plug would not spark. However during a subsequent test the spark plugs, with the exception of #5, did test properly. A complete engine teardown did not reveal evidence of mechanical failure or pre-impact engine discrepancy.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with object\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
