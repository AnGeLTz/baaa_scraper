The aircraft flew at a low altitude in the area of Wanaw\u00e1s to drop supplies. While manoeuvering in the area, a soldier of the Sandinista Popular Army fired a portable Strela-2M missile (also known as SA-7). The missile hit the left hand engine but did not explode. The cabin filled with smoke, forcing the pilot to carry out a forced landing. The crew initially survived but the co-pilot died of his injuries on 26 October 1983.\r\nSource: ASN", "probable_cause": "Shot down by a surface-to-air missile. "}
