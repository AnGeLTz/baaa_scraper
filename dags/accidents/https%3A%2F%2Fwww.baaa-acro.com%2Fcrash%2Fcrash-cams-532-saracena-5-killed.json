In a snowstorm, it lost some 1,000 metres in few seconds due to strong downdrafts. The pilot increased the engine power to gain altitude when the airplane impacted a tree located on the top of the Mt Terrione and crashed. Due to poor weather conditions, SAR operations were unable to localize the airplane and the first rescuers arrived on site five days later, on April 28. Three passengers were found seriously injured while all five other occupants, among them all three crew, were killed. \r\nCrew: \r\nAndr\u00e9 Corouge, pilot,\r\nMr. Guillotaux, radio navigator,\r\nMr. Leroux, mechanic.
