After takeoff, the airplane encountered difficulties to gain height and 10 minutes later, while in clouds, the right wing struck trees. On impact, the right engine and six meters of the right wing were torn off. Out of control the airplane crashed in a wooded area located 10 km from An Khe, killing all 46 occupants. \r\nCrew:\r\nCpt Harry Richard Crumley,\r\nCpt Edward Clarence Handly, \r\nS/Sgt Leonard Williams, \r\nS/Sgt Richard Duane Youtsey.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the right engine failed during initial climb, probably after a concentration of magnesium ignited, causing huge damages to the nacelle and the carburetor. It was reported that the crew encountered technical issues with the right engine that failed twice prior to departure. Contributing factors were poor maintenance and poor weather conditions with low clouds down to 300 feet with a limited visibility. The crew was forced to initiate the flight under VFR mode which was not appropriate in such weather conditions. "}
