Shortly later, the airplane entered an uncontrolled descent and reached the vertical speed of 3,360 - 11,000 feet per minute. Once the altitude of 3,000 meters was reached on descent, the vertical speed increased from 9,850 to 24,600 feet per minute. The airplane then made a turn to the right, got inverted and partially disintegrated at an altitude of 650 meters. Debris crashed at a speed of 890 km/h in an uninhabited area located 13 km northeast of Parchum. Debris scattered on a large zone and miraculously, a passenger was found alive while 83 other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the accident. However, the assumption that the loss of control was caused by the failure of a fuel line was not ruled out. This may cause the fuel to leak into the engine and to ignite while in contact with high temperature equipments. "}
