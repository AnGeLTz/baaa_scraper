Upon landing, the Tupolev collided with a CSA Ilyushin II-18V registered OK-NAA. With six crew members on board, the II-18 was just cleared to line up for takeoff. While the II-18 was slightly damaged, the TU-134 veered off runway, lost its undercarriage and came to rest in a snow covered field. All 48 occupants were evacuated safely, four of them were injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the air traffic controller based in the tower just cleared the crew of the II-18 to line up on the same runway where the crew of the TU-134 was cleared to land few seconds earlier. The separation time was insufficient. The lack of visibility was considered as a contributing factor as both crew failed to see each other. "}
