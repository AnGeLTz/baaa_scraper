The lead airplane pilot reported to him, via the airplane's radio, that he had encountered decreasing visibility and that he was making a 180\u00b0 left turn to exit the area. The pilot recalled that, after losing sight of the lead airplane, he made a shallow climbing right turn and noticed that the terrain was rising. He recalled that he entered the clouds for a few seconds and \"at that moment I ran into the trees which I never saw coming.\" The airplane sustained substantial damage to both wings. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot reported that the temperature was 60\u00b0F with 8 miles visibility and 1,500-eeft ceilings. The nearest METAR was about 1 mile away and reported that the temperature was 54\u00b0F, dew point was 52\u00b0F, visibility was 8 statute miles with light rain, and ceiling was broken at 500 feet and overcast at 1,500 feet.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadvertent flight into instrument meteorological conditions and subsequent controlled flight into terrain."}
