During the flight, the aircraft (Douglas A-26C, N4813E) crashed in mountainous terrain at an elevation of about 11,200 feet near Baldy Mountain. Scouting personnel, who were camped in the vicinity, reported the weather was poor with a low ceiling, restricted visibility, rain and hail. An examination of the crash site revealed the aircraft impacted in a steep, right wing low, nose low attitude. Much of the wreckage collapsed into the impact crater. The degree of destruction was consistent with a high speed impact. Chordwise scratch marks were found on the prop blades. Several tree branches and limbs at the crash site had smooth cuts. The pilot was type rated in the A-26, but his certificate had a limitation that restricted him to flying it in 'VFR only.' Neither the pilot nor the rated passenger held an instrument rating. The rated passenger did not have a type rating in the A-26, but the pilot possessed a waiver to fly N4813E as a single pilot airplane. Both occupants were killed.
