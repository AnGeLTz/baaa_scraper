Due to the inexperience of the pilot, it landed short distance from shore (St Margarets Bay) and sank. All four crew members were seriously injured.\r\nCrew:\r\nP/O J. M. McQueen, pilot, \r\nP/O G. W. H. Charles, navigator, \r\nSgt W. R. MacDonald, wireless operator, \r\nSgt R. H. McKay, air gunner. ", "probable_cause": "Error in judgement of pilot in that he mistook local weather conditions to be general and with ample fuel for four hours failed to examine or confirm by flight to or radio the weather at alternate landing fields. In this case, weather at four alternative landing fields within easy range, Moncton, Debert, Dartmouth and Yarmouth, was good. Reduced visibility at nightfall was a contributing factor. "}
