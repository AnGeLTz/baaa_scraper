The crew shut down the engine and feathered the propeller before completing a circuit to return to the airport. On final, the crew encountered icing conditions and as the aircraft was not properly aligned, the captain decided to initiate a go-around when the aircraft lost height and crashed in a field with its undercarriage partially retracted. The aircraft slid for 418 metres before coming to rest 6 km from the airport. All 51 occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
