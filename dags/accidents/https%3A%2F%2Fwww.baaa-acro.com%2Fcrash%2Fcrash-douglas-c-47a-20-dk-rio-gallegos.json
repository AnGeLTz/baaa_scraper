After a run of about 600 meters, it lifted in a gentle curve to the left but hit the ground again off the runway, skidding to the right. The impact broke the left landing gear strut and the aircraft came to rest after travelling about 96 meters. A fire broke out in the left engine nacelle and could not be put out because of the lack of adequate fire fighting equipment at the aerodrome. No injuries were sustained by the four crew members and one passenger on board at the time of the accident (0820LT).", "probable_cause": "The probable cause of this accident was the fall cf the aircraft when the pilot decided to discontinue a take-off which he considered abnormal and which is attributed to the fact that the propeller was probably feathered, for undetermined reasons."}
