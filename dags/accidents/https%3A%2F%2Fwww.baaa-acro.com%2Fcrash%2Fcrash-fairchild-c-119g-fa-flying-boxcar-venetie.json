It was about 3,000 feet in elevation and was snow covered most of the year, as on the day of the accident. The strip accommodated takeoffs to the south only due to grading and obstructions. Frequently, this meant a downwind takeoff. On the day of the accident, there was a 5 knots wind from the north with gusts to 10 knots. The pilot said that nose wheel steering was not effective due to the surface and the rudder was not responsive due to the tailwind. Most pilots used a 25\u00b0 (right turn) dogleg of the runway at the north end to start their takeoff, especially when tailwinds were present. The accident aircraft went off the runway to the left and collided with a snowbank where it nosed over. All four occupants escaped uninjured.
