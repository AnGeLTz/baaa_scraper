The decision to abort the takeoff procedure was taken but the remaining distance was about 500 meters. Unable to stop within the end of the runway, the airplane overran, went down a ravine and eventually collided with a building located 290 meters further. Both pilots and seven people in the building were killed while few others were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. The decision to abort takeoff was taken after V1 speed fixed at 252 km/h. ", "probable_cause": "It is reported that the captain had the impression that the speed dropped due to an engine failure. However, investigations did not show any technical anomalies with the engines and the decision to abort takeoff was unfounded. The accident occurred during a partial solar eclipse, which could have influenced or affected the pilot's perceptions."}
