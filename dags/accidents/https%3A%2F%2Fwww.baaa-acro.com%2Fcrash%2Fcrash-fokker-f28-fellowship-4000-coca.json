Too low on final, the aircraft landed 4,5 metres short of runway. Upon impact, the left main gear was torn off. The aircraft rolled for 112 metres then veered off runway to the left, rolled another 263 metres then came to rest against a concrete wall. All 65 occupants were rescued, among them seven passengers were injured. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew thought the Coca runway was short. To be able to stop the plane on the runway without excessive use of the brakes, the crew decided to land as early as possible. Doing so, the aircraft landed 4,5 metres short of runway. The published procedure request a minimum altitude of 50 feet over the threshold and the AFM showed a landing distance of 930 metres needed at maximum landing weight considering 42\u00b0 of flaps, speed brakes out, lift dumpers armed, antiskid operative. Wrong approach procedure on part of the crew. "}
