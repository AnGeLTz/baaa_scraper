After departing Toussus-le-Noble Airport, the pilot completed some manoeuvres over the region when one of the propeller blade detached and impacted the fuselage. The engine vibrated dangerously while the control of the aircraft became hazardous. The pilot realized it was not possible to fly back to the airport so he decided to abandon the aircraft and bailed out. The aircraft crashed in an open field and was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire. The pilot was killed as the parachute straps were not correctly secured.
