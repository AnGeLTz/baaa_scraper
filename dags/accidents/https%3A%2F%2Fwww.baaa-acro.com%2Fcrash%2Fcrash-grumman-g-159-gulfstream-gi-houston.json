Hobby Airport, a low oil pressure in the right engine gearbox forced the crew to shut down the engine and to feather its propeller. For unknown reason, the propeller was not properly feathered and the airplane was approaching too low and too fast. After touchdown, as the airplane already rolled half of the landing distance (7,600 feet), the captain decided to initiate a go-around. After liftoff, fire was observed coming out from the tail exhaust pipe while the left engine lost power. The crew attempted an emergency landing and completed a belly landing in an open field near the airport. All 20 occupants were rescued, among them a passenger was seriously injured. The aircraft was written off. ", "probable_cause": "Wheels-up landing following a go-around after the crew failed to follow approved procedures.
