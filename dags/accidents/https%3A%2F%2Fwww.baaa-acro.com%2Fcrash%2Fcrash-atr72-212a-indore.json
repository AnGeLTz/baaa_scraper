On coming to the runway the aircraft touched down moderately hard and bounced high. The pilots were perhaps determined to salvage the abnormal situation and added power to the engines with intention to cushion the sink-rate and settle the runway. On the contrary, the aircraft came hard on the runway and bounced once again. This got followed with a series of bounces in succession. While bouncing the aircraft migrated from the runway and finally came to full halt on right side close to the airport boundary wall. There was no fire in the accident. All 53 occupants evacuated safely. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command in absence of bounce recovery guidance adopted self-perceived technique and kept on adding engine power along with aircraft pitch manipulations to salvage the aircraft from the bounce on landing, and gravely damaged the aircraft structure."}
