At 08.53 hrs, due to bad meteorological conditions on Ia\u0219i Airport the crew requested to Bac\u0103u ACC permission for landing on Bac\u0103u Airport. Bac\u0103u ACC has granted permission and informed the crew about the meteorological conditions in that moment at Bac\u0103u Airport. The crew confirmed. During the aircraft was performing the approach procedure, the crew was instructed to contact the precision radar (PAR) and was informed that at that moment the visibility range was 800 metres. At the first approach PAR sent to the crew all the appropriate data for the radar assistance and in the final stage has asked the crew to perform a missed landing, go up to 900 metres and to contact Bac\u0103u TWR because the aircraft was away from the runway centerline (approx. 60 metres left). On Bac\u0103u TWR frequency the crew received the indication to perform a right turn to intercept the QDM 342 degrees at Bac\u0103u. It was also stated that the runway beacon is running. The crew was instructed, also, to contact PAR which assisted the aircraft, with the necessary corrections, during the approach procedure and landing until the crew reported the accident at 0930LT.", "probable_cause": "Further the analysis of the flight recordings between the aircraft and the Romanian Air Traffic Services, statements and all other data contained by the investigation file the following conclusions have been reached:\r\n- The meteorological conditions at Ia\u0219i Airport were difficult and have not permitted the landing of the aircraft,\r\n- The decision for landing on Bac\u0103u Airport was made by the crew,\r\n- At the moment the meteorological conditions at Bac\u0103u Airport assured the minimum conditions for landing the aircraft,\r\n- The air traffic control was performed by Bac\u0103u TWR and PAR, according to international regulations, providing permanent information regarding the aircraft during the final approach for landing.\r\nWe mention that after the first missed landing the crew maintained its decision to perform a second approach for landing, knowing the meteorological conditions on Bac\u0103u Airport."}
