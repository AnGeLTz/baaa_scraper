After receiving IFR clearance for Wake Island, the crew reported ready for takeoff and requested the use of the paved runway overrun area. The request was approved. The aircraft failed to rotate at 121 knots (V2) and even accelerated through 128 knots without being able to rotate. The engines were stopped and maximum braking was applied, but the aircraft overran and ran through a fence. The landing gear failed and the aircraft slid to a stop 1700 feet from the runway end. All four crew members were injured and the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Improper cargo loading which resulted in the inability of the aircraft to be rotated for take-off under existing conditions. It appeared that the aircraft had been loaded incorrectly causing takeoff centre of gravity to be well forward of the allowable limit."}
