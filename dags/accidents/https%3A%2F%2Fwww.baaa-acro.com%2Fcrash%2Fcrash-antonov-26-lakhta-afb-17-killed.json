Weather conditions were poor with low clouds at 120 metres, a visibility of 1,500 metres and snow squalls. On final, at a distance of 2,700 metres from the runway threshold, the aircraft was 30 metres below the glide. Once the crew reached the decision altitude, he decided to continue despite he did not establish any visual contact with the ground. At a speed of 220-240 km/h and at a height of 16 metres, the right wing collided with trees.
