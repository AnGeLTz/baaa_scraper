The crew was cleared to divert to Belize City and few minutes later, the propeller detached from engine n\u00b01 and struck the engine n\u00b02. The propeller on engine n\u00b02 was feathered and on approach, the crew was unable to lower the left main gear that remained partially retracted and could not be locked down. In such conditions, the captain decided to make a go-around and to recycle the gear, without success. Eventually, the crew completed a landing with the left main gear partially retracted. Upon touchdown, the left wing touched the runway surface and the airplane veered off runway to the left and came to rest in a grassy area. While all three crew members were uninjured, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the engine n\u00b01 and loss of its propeller for unknown reasons."}
