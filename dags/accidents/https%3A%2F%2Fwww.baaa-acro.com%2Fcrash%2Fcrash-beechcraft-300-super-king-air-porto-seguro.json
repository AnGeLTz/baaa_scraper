On impact, the left main landing gear was torn off. The aircraft slid on runway for few dozen metres then veered to the left and came to a halt. All 10 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The following factors were identified:\r\n- Application of the commands - contributed\r\nThere was no effective action on the aircraft controls during the final approach to avoid a brutal impact with the ground prior to the runway threshold.\r\n- Adverse weather conditions - undetermined\r\nIt is possible that the aircraft was under the effect of the phenomenon known as windshear, which affected the approach profil and the subsequent impact with the ground short of runway.\r\n- Pilot judgement - contributed\r\nThe risks of a possible windshear during the final approach were not adequately considered by the pilot. The decision to proceed for the landing, to the detriment of the alternative recommended by experts to perform a missed approach, proved decisive for the development of the accident."}
