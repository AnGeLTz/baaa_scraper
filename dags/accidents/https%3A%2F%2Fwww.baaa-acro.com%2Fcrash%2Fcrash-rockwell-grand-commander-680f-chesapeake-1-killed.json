The aircraft was observed to depart Lawrence County Airpark and upon reaching a point over the runway end, an engine started making a popping sound. The pilot radioed on unicom that he was having trouble with the aircraft. The aircraft climbed to an estimated 500 feet and a left turn away from the Ohio River and toward the hills was started. Witnesses observed aircraft porpoise in flight and said that at least once it sounded as if both engines quit momentarily then restarted. Then aircraft rolled into left bank and struck trees on ridgetop. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
