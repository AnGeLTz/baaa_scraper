While on an ILS approach to Zurich-Kloten Airport runway 14, while at an altitude of 600 meters, the twin engine aircraft deviated from the glide, proceeded to a flat attitude when it entered a rapid descent and crashed 1,500 meters short of runway. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and both occupants were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of an aircraft that, while flying in cat I weather conditions, entered an excessive nose-down and unstabilized attitude while passing from IFR to VFR mode until it struck the ground before runway threshold. It is possible that the pilot suffered an optical illusion, which would remain a contributory factor as well as the fact that the windshield was covered by frost, reducing the pilot visibility.  "}
