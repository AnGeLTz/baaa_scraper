For unknown reasons, he decided to takeoff from another area in the field, with a light and non significant wind component. In a relative muddy ground, the takeoff distance was too short when the pilot realized the presence of a ditch. He attempted to takeoff but the aircraft' speed was too low. It nosed down, crashed and came to rest upside down. All three passengers escaped with minor injuries while the pilot was seriously injured. He died from his injuries the following evening.  ", "probable_cause": "The decision of the pilot to takeoff from an insufficient distance and his decision to initiate the rotation prematurely as the aircraft' speed was too low. "}
