Named 'American Legion', the aircraft was the first prototype of the Keystone K-47 Pathfinder and built especially for this crew and mission. From the airbase of Langley, Virginia, the crew was performing a local training flight around the base. Shortly after takeoff, while climbing to a height of 50 feet, the crew noted the presence of trees and made a sharp turn to the left. At an insufficient speed, the aircraft stalled and crashed in a swampy area and was destroyed. Both occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": null}
