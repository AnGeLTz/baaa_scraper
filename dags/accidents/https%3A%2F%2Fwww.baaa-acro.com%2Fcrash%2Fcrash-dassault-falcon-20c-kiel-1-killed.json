After touchdown, the crew realized he would not be able to stop the airplane within the remaining distance and decided to initiate a go-around procedure. Power was added on both engines and the aircraft took off. After passing over the runway end at low altitude, the aircraft struck trees, stalled and crashed in a wooded area. Nine occupants were injured, some of them seriously, while one pilot was killed. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who completed the approach at an excessive speed and above the glide. This caused the aircraft to land too far down a runway and the landing distance available was insufficient. After touchdown, the crew failed to identify the situation in due time and the decision to initiate a go-around procedure was taken too late. The following contributing factors were reported: \r\n- Poor crew coordination, \r\n- Poor planned approach and crew decisions, \r\n- Wet runway surface (poor braking coefficient),\r\n- Rain falls. "}
