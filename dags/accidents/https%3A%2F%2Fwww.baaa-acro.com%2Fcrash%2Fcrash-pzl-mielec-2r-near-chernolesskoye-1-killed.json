While flying at a height of about 9 metres, trying to get altitude, the single engine aircraft successively collided with power cables and a concrete pylon, continued for about 99 metres then crashed in an open field, bursting into flames. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post impact fire and the pilot was killed.", "probable_cause": "The accident occurred during crop-dusting flight due to late aircraft entry into climb for flying over PTL resulted in aircraft collision with power transmission line tower on a field under cultivation, followed by ground impact and fire. Probably late aircraft entry into climb was caused by PIC performance impairment (final crop dusting in final flight was performed after which PIC had to rest during 1,5 hours and short recreation cycle was disordered during flight operation), and also low-observability of PTL wires without day marking."}
