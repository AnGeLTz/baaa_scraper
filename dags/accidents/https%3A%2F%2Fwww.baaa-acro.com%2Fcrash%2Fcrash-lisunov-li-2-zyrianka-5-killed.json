The takeoff was started by night and in snow falls from a contaminated runway. After a long takeoff course, the pilot-in-command completed the rotation at low speed. After liftoff, the airplane reached a high angle of attack, stalled and struck the runway surface several times. It continued for few hundred yards then banked left and eventually crashed in flames in a snowy field located 440 meters past the runway end. The passenger was slightly injured while all five crew members were killed. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The crew took the decision to takeoff from a contaminated runway that has not been properly cleaned prior to the accident. In such conditions, all safety conditions were not met and the aircraft performances were reduced. For undetermined reason, the crew decided to continue the takeoff run despite the course was too long and failed to take  the right decision to abandon the departure procedure."}
