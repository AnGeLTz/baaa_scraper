The pilot was initially cleared for one runway, but was unable to get a safe gear indication. The pilot made a 180\u00b0 turn to land on the opposite runway while attempting to get a safe gear indication. On turn from base to final, with the gear down and locked, the pilot overshot final approach. The pilot then chose an unlit parking lot to make an off-airport landing. The aircraft struck a tree and a power line. The aircraft struck several parked unoccupied vehicles during the landing. The faa reported that an on-site inspection revealed a failed right turbocharger. Both occupants were seriously injured. \n", "probable_cause": "The pilot's misjudgement of the forced landing profile.
