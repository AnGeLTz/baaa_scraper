After being able to lower the undercarriage manually, the crew continued the approach but landed on runway 10 in a flapless configuration. Because the brakes and the thrust reversers were unserviceable, the crew was unable to stop the aircraft within the remaining distance. The aircraft overran, struck a drainage ditch and came to rest 300 metres past the runway end. All occupants were rescued, among them five were slightly injured.
