He attempted to feather the propeller but was unable. He initiated a descent to extinguish the fire and was successful but after leveling off, was unable to maintain directional control. He ditched the airplane and both he and the passenger exited the aircraft. The pilot dragged the seriously injured passenger with him to a nearby island where they were rescued the following day. The aircraft was not recovered; therefore, no determination could be made as to the reason for the separation of the cylinder. Review of the aircraft logbook indicates that on 8/27/91, the n\u00b05 cylinder of the right engine was removed and replaced. Also, the n\u00b01 cylinder was removed and reinstalled following repair. There were no further entries in the aircraft logbook regarding cylinder removal or replacement to the right engine.", "probable_cause": "For undetermined reason(s), the right engine failed and the right propeller would not feather."}
