Shortly later, the aircraft hit the slope of a mountain and was totally destroyed on impact. All five crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The aircraft was so disintegrated by impact forces that it was impossible to determine if any technical failure may occur prior to the accident. Nevertheless, investigations were conducted by the staff of the Yuma Airbase and it was determined that the crew was flying on visual mode despite the fact that the visibility was reduced to due poor weather conditions. As this was not appropriate considering weather conditions (thunderstorm activity), the crew appears to be lost and was not following the assigned track. In such conditions, it would be better that the crew follow the route along the Colorado River. "}
