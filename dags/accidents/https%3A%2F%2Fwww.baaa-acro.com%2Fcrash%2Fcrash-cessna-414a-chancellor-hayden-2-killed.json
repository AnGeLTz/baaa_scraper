A review of on-board global positioning system (GPS) data indicated that the airplane flew through the approach course several times during the approach and was consistently below the glideslope path. The airplane continued below the published decision height altitude and drifted to the right of the runway\u2019s extended centerline. The GPS recorded the pilot\u2019s attempt to perform a missed approach, a rapid decrease in ground speed, and then the airplane descend to the ground, consistent with an aerodynamic stall. Further, the airplane owner, who was also a passenger on the flight, stated that, after the pilot made the two \u201cleft turning circles\u201d and had begun a third circle, he perceived that the airplane \u201cjust stalled.\u201d An examination of the airframe and engine did not detect any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane\u2019s anti-ice and propeller anti-ice switches were found in the \u201coff\u201d position. A review of weather information revealed that the airplane was operating in an area with the potential for moderate icing and snow. Based on the GPS data and weather information, it is likely that the airframe collected ice during the descent and approach, which affected the airplane\u2019s performance and led to an aerodynamic stall during the climb.\n", "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s inadvertent stall during a missed approach. Contributing to the accident was the pilot\u2019s operation of the airplane in forecasted icing conditions without using all of its anti-ice systems.\n"}
