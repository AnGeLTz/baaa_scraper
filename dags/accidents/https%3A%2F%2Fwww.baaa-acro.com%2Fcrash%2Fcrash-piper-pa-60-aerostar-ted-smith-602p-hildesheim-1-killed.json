After takeoff, the climb gradient was low then the airplane lost height and descended until it impacted a wall and crashed in an industrial area located about 900 metres from the runway end, bursting into flames. The aircraft was totally destroyed and the pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was due to the fact that the aircraft did not gain altitude after takeoff, went into an uncontrolled flight condition and crashed. There was a high probability that a disturbance of the pilot's consciousness and a considerable reduced capacity of action from the pilot contributed to the accident."}
