On short final, about 4,800 metres short of runway 06 threshold, the aircraft was too high on the glide and the captain decided to make a correction. After touchdown, the crew initiated the braking procedure but the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran the wet runway (1,737 metres long) and came to rest 150 metres further. All 65 occupants were evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who continued the descent too high on the glide. It was reported that the landing speed was slightly above Vref at 123 knots and the aircraft suffered aquaplaning as the runway surface was wet. "}
