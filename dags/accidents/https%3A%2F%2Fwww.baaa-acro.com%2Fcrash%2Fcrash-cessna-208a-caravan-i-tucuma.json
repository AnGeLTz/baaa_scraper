", "probable_cause": "The following findings were reported:\r\n- There was a deficiency in the instruction received, since the crew did not perform emergency training on that type of aircraft, resulting in inadequate preparation for the engine failure situation, especially at low altitude,\r\n- There are indications that the maintenance services were inadequate and contributed to the occurrence of engine failure, due to the possible occurrence of compressor stall,\r\n- The company performed inadequate technical and operational oversight for not providing emergency situations for the crews of that type of aircraft involved in the accident."}
