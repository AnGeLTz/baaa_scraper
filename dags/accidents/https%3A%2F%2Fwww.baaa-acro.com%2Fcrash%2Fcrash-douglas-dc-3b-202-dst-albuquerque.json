At a height of a about 100 feet, the airplane rolled 5\u00b0 to the left. The captain decided to return to the airport but realized this was impossible. He took the decision to reduce his altitude and to attempt an emergency landing in a field. While contacting the ground, the aircraft slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest. All 11 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.\r\nCrew:\r\nHarold Hess, pilot,\r\nBronson White, copilot,\r\nOlga C.
