The aircraft left Glasgow-Renfrew Airport and headed south to Liverpool but nothing further was heard and when it failed to arrive at its destination, a SAR operation was started. A local resident found the debris on a hill two days later, near the Clatteringshaws Reservoir, some 16 miles southwest of Newton Stewart. All four occupants were killed and the aircraft was destroyed. \r\nCrew:\r\nLeslie T. Jackson, pilot,\r\nArchibald Francis Phillpot, radio operator. \r\nPassengers:\r\nHarold J. Pemberton, journalist for the Daily Express,\r\nReginald Charles Wesley, photographer for the Daily Express.", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident is unknown, but it is assumed that the pilot descended below safe limits in order to follow what he believed to be the coastline or the line of the Solway Firth. Unfortunately, the aircraft was flying too low and in poor visibility, so it contacted a hill known as 'Darnaw'."}
