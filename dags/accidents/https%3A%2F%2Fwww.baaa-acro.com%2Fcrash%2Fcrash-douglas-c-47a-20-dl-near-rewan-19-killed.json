The aircraft was unable to land at Gorrie because the airfield was out of order, so the crew landed at Daly Waters where additional passengers were picked up. The aircraft arrived in Cloncurry at 1245LT where three more Australian soldiers boarded the aircraft. En route from Cloncurry to Brisbane, the aircraft went through a thunderstorm area, broke up in mid-air and crashed in the Carnarvon canyon located southwest of Rewan. The wreckage was found two days later and all 19 occupants were killed. \r\nCrew (21st Transport Group:\r\n2nd Lt Raymond E. Anglin, pilot,\r\n2nd Lt Joseph W. Kennedy, copilot,\r\nSgt Frank J.
