Two takeoff attempts were rejected because the aircraft was too heavy. In such conditions, the captain decided to start the takeoff roll from a further point at the airport. On the third attempt, after a course of 1,500 metres, the aircraft impacted a dirt bank. The undercarriage were torn off and the airplane crashed. The radio operator was seriously injured and all six other occupants were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nThaeke Wiersma, pilot,\r\nJan van Onlangs, copilot,\r\nG. van Zadelhoff, radio operator,\r\nJ. F. W. O. Kotte, mechanic. ", "probable_cause": "The total weight of the aircraft was too high at the time of the accident, this explain why the airplane was unable to leave the ground. Additionally, it appears that a cockpit panel was improperly secured during the takeoff roll that was completed in heavy rain falls, which was considered as a contributory factor."}
