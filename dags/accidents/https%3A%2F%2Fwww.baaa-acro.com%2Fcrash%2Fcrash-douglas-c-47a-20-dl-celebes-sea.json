It trimmed and climbed, then stalled, went into spin and flattened out at 3,000 feet above mean sea level. The pilot was able to regain control and then decided to ditch the aircraft off Labuan. While the aircraft sank, all 23 occupants were unhurt and took refuge in life rafts. They were rescued about 15 hours later some 150 miles east of Tarakan.\r\nCrew (345th Squadron):\r\nF/O A.
