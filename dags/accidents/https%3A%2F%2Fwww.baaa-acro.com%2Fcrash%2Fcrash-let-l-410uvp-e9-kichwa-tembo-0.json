On departure from Kichwa Tembo, there were four passengers and two pilots on board. During the takeoff roll from runway 08, the aircraft hit a bump half way down the runway and bounced. The aircraft hit a second bump shortly later and as the crew heard the stall alarm, he decided to reject takeoff. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, lost its nose gear and came to rest 300 metres further. All six occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
