Aircraft rotated at about 2,000 feet down runway and climbed in a flat nose high attitude before settling into 30 feet trees about 4,223 feet from point of lift-off. Aircraft oscillated violently 2 or 3 times in the pitch axis during the 20-30 seconds flight. Aircraft was about 445 lbs over max gross weight and CofG was 4.26 inches aft of the aft limit. On 6/9/82 the pilot took a checkride to have a \"centerline thrust only\" restriction removed from his multi-engine rating. 59 of his 62 hrs multi-engine were as copilot. He had no formal C414 training and had recovered only 2 hours of instruction in conventional multi-engine aircraft. He had never been required to perform weight and balance computations in his military flying or any FAA exam or checkrides. Company management did not comply with insurance stipulations which required pilot of the flight to attend a Cessna flight training school, nor did the pilot satisfy the minimum hour requirements. FAA certificate examiner lost certificate on 7/10/82, history of incomplete or substandard checkrides.
