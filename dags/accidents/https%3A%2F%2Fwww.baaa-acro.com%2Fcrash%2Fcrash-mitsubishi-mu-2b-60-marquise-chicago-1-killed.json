Six minutes later on second takeoff, the aircraft climbed to 50 feet, drifted to the right, rolled right and impacted in the infield. This was a single pilot operation in a complex aircraft. Winds exceeded the demonstrated crosswind limitation of the aircraft. There was no evidence that the pilot was using the seat belt or shoulder harness. Post crash investigation of both engines and props determined that there were no operational defects and that both were producing power at the time of impact. Strong gusty winds varying in intensity from 15 to 30 knots and varying in direction from southwest to northwest were prevalent at the airport on the day of the accident. The prop condition levers were found in the taxi position and the power levers were set with the left engine near flight idle position and the right engine at the takeoff position. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
