In below weather minima, the crew descended below the minimum safe altitude until the aircraft struck the ground and crashed in a swampy area located about 6 km short of runway. The aircraft was destroyed on impact and six occupants including both pilots were killed. All 13 other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain. The following findings were reported: \r\n- The company had failed to implement a standardized concept of aircraft operation that the pilots fully respected and lived by;\r\n- The approach briefing was not not fully implemented in accordance with the rules. There were deficiencies in:\r\n- \"Call outs\" during the approach\r\n- Descent rate (feet/min) during \"FAF inbound\"\r\n- Timing \"outbound\" from the IAF and the time from FAF to MAPt;\r\n- The crew did not execute the \"base turn\" at the scheduled time, with the consequence that the plane ended up about 14 NM from the airport;\r\n- The Pilot Flying ended the approach with reference to aircraft instruments and continued on a visual approach in the dark without visual reference to the underlying terrain. During this part of the approach the aircraft's position was not positively checked using any available navigational aids;\r\n- Both crew members had in all likelihood most of the attention out of the cockpit at the airport after the Pilot Not Flying announced that he had it in sight;\r\n- The crew was never aware of how close they were the underlying terrain;\r\n- The last part of the descent from about 500 feet indicated altitude to 392 feet can be caused by inattention to the fact that the plane may have been a little out of trim after the descent;\r\n- Crew Cooperation during the approach was not in accordance with with the CRM concept and seems to have ceased completely after the Pilot Not Flying called \"field in sight\";\r\n- Before the accident the company had not succeeded well enough with the introduction of standardization and internal control/quality assurance. This was essentially because the management had not placed enough emphasis on awareness and motivate employees;\r\n- The self-control system described in the airline operations manual and the parts of the quality system, was not incorporated in the organization and served as poor safety governing elements;\r\n- Neither the Norwegian CAA nor the company had defined what visual reference to terrain is, what sufficient visual references are and what the references must be in relation to a moving aircraft."}
