Investigation revealed the pilot held a private certificate with asmel ratings. His medical certificate was denied because he failed to provide information concerning high blood pressure and alcoholism. Copilot held a commercial certificate with asel rating. No evidence was found to indicate that either pilot had any operating experience in the Martin 404 aircraft. Former employees of operator stated that N40443 was not well maintained. The ADI system and interior lights were inoperative. Weight of aircraft at the time of accident was calculated to be 44,492 pounds. The max gross total weight for a 'dry' takeoff from a 4,500 foot runway was approximately 37,900 pounds. The flight manual performance charts indicate that a runway length of over 5,500 feet would be needed for an aircraft at 44,492 pounds. The aircraft collided with a dirt bank during takeoff.
