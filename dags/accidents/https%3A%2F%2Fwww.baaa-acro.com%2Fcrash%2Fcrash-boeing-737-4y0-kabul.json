On short final, the aircraft entered an area of heavy rain falls. The crew continued the approach and the aircraft landed after the touchdown zone. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, lost its undercarriage, collided with the ILS antenna and slid for 285 metres before coming to rest. All 132 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew completed the landing too far down the runway, reducing the landing distance available. The following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- The crew failed to follow SOP's, \r\n- Poor crew recurrent training, \r\n- The thrust reverse systems were activated too late after landing. "}
