Several manual attempts were made and finally, only the right main gear remained stuck in its wheel well. The captain decided to land in such configuration. After touchdown, the aircraft slid on the ground then veered off runway and came to rest in a grassy area. All 62 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The right main gear could not be lowered because of a breakage of the filling connection of the hydraulic tank due to metal fatigue while the aircraft was taxiing at Moscow-Sheremetyevo Airport. The fitting was blown out under pressure and damaged hydraulic lines, causing a hydraulic fluid leak and the oil pressure to drop."}
