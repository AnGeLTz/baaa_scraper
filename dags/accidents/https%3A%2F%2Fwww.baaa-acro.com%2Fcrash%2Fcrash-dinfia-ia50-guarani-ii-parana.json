Pilots initiated a go-around procedure and while climbing, elected to retract the landing gear but without success. Flaps remained blocked in an inappropriate angle while the hydraulic pressure dropped. Decision was taken to return to Paran\u00e1 Airport where the landing gear collapsed upon landing. The aircraft slid on its belly and came to rest. Both pilots evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that on approach to Santa Elena Airstrip, the crew failed to realize his altitude was too low when the undercarriage struck iron pipes stored in an area of tall grass short of runway threshold.
