IFR flight to Eagle was uneventful and radar service was terminated after the controller cleared the flight for the lDA-A approach to the Eagle Airport which shows a 239\u00b0 inbound course. The last radio contact occurred when the crew replied 'we're 8 to 10 out and it's clear ahead' to Eagle radio in answer to a request for a base report. The flight collided with an 8,022 foot msl mountaintop bearing 298\u00b0, 3.88 miles from the airport while in the approach configuration. The safety board believes the flight was circling to land on runway 07, and the dark night prevented required visual lookout to avoid terrain obstructions. The Jeppesen approach charts used by the flightcrew did not accurately depict terrain obstructions within the 5-mile radius of the airport as stipulated in their legend. The safety board believes this could have mislead the flightcrew. All three occupants were killed.
