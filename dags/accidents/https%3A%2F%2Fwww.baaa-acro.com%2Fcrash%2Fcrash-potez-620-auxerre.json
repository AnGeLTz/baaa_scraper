The right engine failed, most probably due to icing, so the captain decided to divert to Auxerre Airport. On approach, the left engine failed as well. Aware he was unable to reach the airport, the captain decided to attempt an emergency landing in a snow covered field located few km short of runway. The airplane named 'Cormoran' landed hard then slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest. All seven occupants evacuated safely and were able to unload all mail bags and cargo when 15 minutes later, a fire erupted and consumed the aircraft that was totally destroyed.\r\nCrew:\r\nMr. Chovard, pilot,\r\nMr. Doussemain, radio navigator,\r\nMr. Berbruck, flight engineer, \r\nMr. Lachance, steward.
