On final approach to Paris-Le Bourget runway 07 by night, the crew encountered limited visibility due to foggy conditions. Apparently in an attempt to establish a visual contact with the approach lights, the crew failed to realize his altitude was too low when the aircraft struck the roof of a warehouse and crashed in Garges-l\u00e8s-Gonesse, less than 2 km short of runway 07 threshold. The aircraft was destroyed by a post crash fire and all seven occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": null}
