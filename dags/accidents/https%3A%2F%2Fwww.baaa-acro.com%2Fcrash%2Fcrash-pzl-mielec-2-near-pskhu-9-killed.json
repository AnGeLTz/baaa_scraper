About 15 minutes later, while cruising at an altitude of 1,450 meters in good weather conditions, the airplane went out of control, struck tree tops and crashed in flames in a wooded area located on the slope of Mt Dzishra (2,623 meters high) located 6 km south of the airfield. The aircraft was totally destroyed by fire and all nine occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined by the fact that the aircraft was totally consumed by fire. Nevertheless, a high concentration of carbon monoxide was found in both pilots blood and it is believed it may be the consequence of smoke spreading in the cabin due to a fire in a hand luggage containing films or a possible electrical short-circuit. The assumption that the loss of control was also the consequence of an in-flight collision with a flock of birds that struck the windshield and injured both pilots was not ruled out. "}
