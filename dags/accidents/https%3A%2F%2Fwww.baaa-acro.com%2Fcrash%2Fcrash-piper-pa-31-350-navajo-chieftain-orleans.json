The flight was passenger charter flight TLP2B. The pilot flying, who was the co-pilot seated in the left seat, was unable to perform the rotation. He aborted the takeoff but braking failed to stop the aircraft before the end of the runway. The runway surface was wet. Marks were left by the tyres from one hundred metres before the end of the runway. The aircraft ran across grass soaked with water. The nose gear broke and the aircraft came to a stop about one hundred and eighty metres after the end of the runway. The crew had forgotten to remove the flight control locking device.", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by the crew\u2019s failure to perform pre-flight actions and checks relating to unblocking and free movement of the flight controls and flight control surfaces. This failure was able to develop to the point of being the cause of the accident as a result of the absence of precise CRM procedures."}
