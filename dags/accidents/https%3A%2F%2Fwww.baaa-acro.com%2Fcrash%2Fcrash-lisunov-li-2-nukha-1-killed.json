After a roll of 124 meters, the tail wheel lifted off when the left main gear struck an irregularity on the runway surface. Instead of abandoning the takeoff procedure, the captain continued and elected to takeoff quickly. He pulled the control column to rotate but the aircraft's speed was too low. The airplane took off but in stall conditions, it bounced several times then rolled down into a ravine and came to rest by the Gurdzhanachay River, some 900 meters past the runway threshold. The copilot was killed and 21 other occupants were injured, some of them seriously. The aircraft was written off. ", "probable_cause": "The takeoff procedure was started from a contaminated runway (compacted snow) and with lateral winds up to 5 meters per second. When an emergency situation occurred (left main gear impact), the captain failed to abandon the takeoff manoeuvre and elected to rotate with an insufficient speed, which caused the aircraft to stall.
