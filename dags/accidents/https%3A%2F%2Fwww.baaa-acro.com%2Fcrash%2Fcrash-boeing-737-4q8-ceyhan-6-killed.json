Nine minutes after takeoff, while climbing to an altitude of 4,000 metres in poor weather conditions, the aircraft nosed down, entered a dive and crashed in a near vertical attitude in an open field located near Ceyhan, about 30 km east of Adana Airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact, causing a large crater. Debris were found at a depth of 10 metres. The accident was not survivable. ", "probable_cause": "The following findings were identified:\r\n- The severe weather conditions probably contributed to the cause of the accident,\r\n- The Pitot static anti-ice system was probably not activated during preparations for flight because the crew failed to follow the pre takeoff checklist,\r\n- The crew failed to recognize the cause of an erratic airspeed indication,\r\n- The crew failed to use other cockpit indications for control and recovery of the airplane,\r\n- The presence of cabin crew in the cockpit probably distracted the attention of the cockpit crew."}
