The aircraft used for the mission was the first of a number of recently acquired American built Lockheed Hudson twin-engine and twin-rudder airplanes installed with a camera and with the rear gun turret not fitted. It was painted with a camouflage marking scheme that was different to the usual RAF pattern which would have dire consequences for the four man crew. While cruising over the region of Gravesend, the twin engine aircraft was attacked and shot down by the pilots of three RAF Hawker Hurricane, engulfed in flames and dove into the ground. During the descent, the copilot was able to bail out before the aircraft crashed in a field near Meopham. All three other occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nF/O Sydney Dennis Slocum, pilot, \u2020\r\nSgt J. A. W.
