Shortly after becoming airborne during the second takeoff, the right engine experienced a power loss. The aircraft was observed to climb to about 50 feet agl, then veer right and crash east of the runway. Other than a malfunctioning right fuel tank selector which allowed fuel to bypass to other fuel tanks, there was no pre-impact failure/malfunction. Both right tanks were empty and the left tanks contained about 175 gallons of fuel. However, subsequent tests showed that fluid in the right tank would bypass the right fuel selector and leak into the left tank when the aircraft sat left wing low for about 12 hours. The aircraft was not airworthy in that all the requirements of an approved 91.217 inspection program were not complied with. The pilot-in-command had 5 hours as pic of DC-3 during the last 5 months with one hour and two takeoff and landings the last 90 days. This was the first flight in a DC-3 for the copilot with no record of any training in the DC-3.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
