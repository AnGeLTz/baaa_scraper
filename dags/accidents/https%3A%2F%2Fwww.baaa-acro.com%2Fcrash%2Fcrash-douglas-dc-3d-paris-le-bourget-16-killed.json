The captain decided to stack for about 30 minutes at an altitude between 700 and 1,000 meters and was later authorized to descent to Le Bourget. On final approach, while at a height of some 150 feet, the aircraft stalled and crashed in a tulip field located 1,500 meters short of runway threshold. Two passengers were seriously injured while all 14 other occupants were killed. Few hours later, both survivors died from their injuries. \r\nCrew:\r\nEdouard Albin, pilot,\r\nGeorges Capron, copilot,\r\nPierre Lebeau, radio navigator, \r\nJoseph Lacroix, mechanic, \r\nMr. Germ\u00e9, steward.

It is believed that the aircraft stalled on final approach, maybe due to an insufficient approach speed. "}
