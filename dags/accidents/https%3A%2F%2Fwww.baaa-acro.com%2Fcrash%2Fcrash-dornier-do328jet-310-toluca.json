Upon touchdown, the airplane went out of control and veered off runway to the right. While contacting soft grounf, the airplane lost its undercarriage and came to rest in a grassy area. All four occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control upon landing due to the exhaust gases of the three turbofan engines and wake turbulences from an heavy category aircraft, causing a runway excursion, and an additional presence of crosswind, resulting in the aircraft rolling over uneven terrain of the safety strip resulting in severe damage.\r\nContributing factors:\r\n- Safety strip in poor condition,\r\n- Failure to attach times and separation distance between an aircraft taking off and landing on the same runway, to avoid the formation of wake turbulence and the presence of the exhaust gases of turbofan engines."}
