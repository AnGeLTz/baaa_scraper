The captain made an overcorrection, causing the aircraft to approach the runway with a high rate of descent. In a nose-up attitude, the aircraft struck the runway surface with a positive acceleration of 5 g. After landing, the crew completed the deceleration and braking procedure, vacated the runway and rolled to the gate where all occupants disembarked safely. A complete inspection of the aircraft by technicians revealed that it suffered major fuselage damages and was later declared as damaged beyond repair.
