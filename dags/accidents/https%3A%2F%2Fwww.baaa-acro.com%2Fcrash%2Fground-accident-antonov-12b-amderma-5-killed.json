Following a uneventful stopover, the crew was cleared to taxi to join the holding point for takeoff. At the same time, a Soviet Air Force Tupolev TU-128 landed when the right main gear collapsed on touchdown. The Tupolev veered off runway and collided with the Antonov that was 125 meters from the main runway, causing both aircraft to burst into flames. Both aircraft were destroyed and both pilots of the Tupolev were killed as well as five crew members on board the Antonov.
