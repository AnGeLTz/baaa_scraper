During the takeoff roll on the Solent, the seaplane was unstable and the captain was unable to maintain the aircraft on the right course so he decided to abandon the takeoff procedure. A float located on the left wing hit the water surface and the left wing was submerged to the outer engine. All 31 occupants were quickly rescued and were uninjured while the aircraft sank. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was due to an error of airmanship by the captain in that he did not ascertain the crosswind component and in consequence attempted to take off under conditions with which he could not contend. The following factors were considered as contributory:\n- The control officer misinformed the captain of the relationship between the wind and the flare path at the time of takeoff,\n- The sudden deterioration of the weather conditions during the takeoff procedure."}
