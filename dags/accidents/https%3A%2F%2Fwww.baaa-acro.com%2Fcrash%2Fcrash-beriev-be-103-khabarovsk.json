It struck the right propeller, causing the right engine to fail. The crew lost control of the aircraft that stalled and crashed in a garden located less than one km from the airport, bursting into flames. The aircraft was destroyed by a post crash fire and all three occupants were seriously injured, among them Alexander Perkash, Director of the company.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of the accidental opening and detachment of the right door during initial climb. The following findings were identified:\r\n- Poor flight preparation, \r\n- The landing gear were still down, increasing drag,\r\n- The distance between the airplane and the ground was insufficient to expect a stall recovery, \r\n- Poor conception of the door lock mechanism, \r\n- The crew failed to check that the door was properly locked prior to departure.
