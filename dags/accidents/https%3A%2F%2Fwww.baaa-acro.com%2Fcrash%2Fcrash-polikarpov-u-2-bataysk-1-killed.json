A second U-2 registered CCCP-Sh924 took off shortly later with also two pilots on board. Sh924 was following L956 when the first aircraft slowed at a speed of 80-85 km/h so the second aircraft could approach. At a height of about 40 metres, the pilot of L956 initiated a turn when both airplanes collided and crashed in a field located 1,5 km from the airport. Two pilots survived and two others were killed.
