Aircraft control was lost during an instrument approach in IMC approximately 2.5 hours later. Both pump driveshafts were found sheared in the wreckage and both broken shaft surfaces showed polished surfaces. During further testing it was discovered that tape or pipe dope had been used in the threading of the intake and outflow fittings of the left pump. No contaminants were found in the right pump but the pump wall inner surfaces gap was approximately .005 inch. This gap is approx 50% over the allowable tolerance for a serviceable air pump. The pressure regulator valve to the attitude indicator gyro and the compass gyro were examined and found to require pressure exceeding normal requirement standards. Both occupants were killed.
