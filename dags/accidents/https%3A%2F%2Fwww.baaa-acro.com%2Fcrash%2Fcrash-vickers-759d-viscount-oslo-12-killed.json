The aircraft was destroyed and all 12 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It is believed the accident was caused by the fact that, during the approach to Fornebu Airport, the pilot lost control of the aircraft at such a low height that recovery was not possible. From the evidence available, it has not been possible for the Commission to determine why this happened. There are possibilities, however, that the cause may have been that ice formed on the stabilizer or that the propellers went over to ground fine pitch. The Commission considers that the latter hypothesis is slightly more than the former."}
