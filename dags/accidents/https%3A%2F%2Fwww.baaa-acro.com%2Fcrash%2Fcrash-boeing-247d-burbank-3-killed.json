All three occupants, two pilots and a stewardess, were killed.", "probable_cause": "Several theories have been suggested as the probable cause of this accident. However, to date, no direct evidence has been uncovered which will substantiate any of them.

It is believed he suffered a spatial disorientation while climbing in low visibility due to poor weather conditions.\n"}
