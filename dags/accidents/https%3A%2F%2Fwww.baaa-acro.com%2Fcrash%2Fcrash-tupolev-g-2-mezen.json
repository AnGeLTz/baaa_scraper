Approaching the destination, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with snow falls reducing visibility to 800 metres. Unable to establish a radio contact with the destination airport station, the captain asked the copilot to check the radio system. Doing so, the captain was distracted and lost visual references with the horizon. The airplane descended to the ground and crashed in a snow covered field. There were no casualties but the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control on approach after the pilot got distracted and lost his visual cues while discussing with the copilot concerning radio problems. The crew decided to continue the descent to the destination airport despite the airport radio station was unserviceable. "}
