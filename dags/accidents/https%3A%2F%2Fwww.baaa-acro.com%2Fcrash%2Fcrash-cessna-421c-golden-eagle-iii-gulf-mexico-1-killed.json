About 25 minutes later, the airplane began to deviate from the ATC-assigned altitude and route. The controller\u2019s attempts to contact the pilot were unsuccessful. The North American Aerospace Defense Command launched military fighter aircraft to intercept the airplane. The military pilots reported that the airplane was circling in a left turn at a high altitude and low airspeed and that its windows were partially frosted over. They also reported that the pilot was slumped over in the cockpit and not moving. They fired flares, and the pilot continued to be unresponsive. The airplane circled for about 3 hours before it descended into the Gulf of Mexico and sank. The pilot and airplane were not recovered. Review of the pilot\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration medical records did not reveal any recent medical conditions that would have deemed him unfit to fly.", "probable_cause": "Pilot incapacitation, which resulted in the pilot\u2019s inability to maintain airplane control and the airplane\u2019s subsequent ocean impact."}
