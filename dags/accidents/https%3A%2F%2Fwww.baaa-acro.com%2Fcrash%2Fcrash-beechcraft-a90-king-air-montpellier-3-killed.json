Following a touch and go on runway 31R, the instructor decided to reduce the power on the right engine and to perform a low pass over the runway. Then the aircraft turned to the left, lost height, rolled to the left and crashed in a pond located to the right of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed and all three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the result of the crew losing control of the aircraft after a go-around. It is likely that this was the result of inadequate management of the flight controls while performing a one engine go-around and a too late a reaction from the examiner (TRE).  The examiner's recent lack of experience in instruction on BE90 and his right-front position may have contributed to the accident. No technical anomalies was found on the aircraft and the loss of control occurred at low altitude. "}
