For unknown reasons, the crew cancelled the flight plan and returned to Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n. A second takeoff was recorded at 2118LT and en route, the crew cancelled again the flight plan as he wanted to divert to Tepic, then Guadalajara and later Puerto Vallarta. After ATC informed the crew that Guadalajara Airport was closed to traffic, the crew finally decided to fly to Tepic. But this airport was also closed to traffic. On final approach to Tepic Airport, the crew failed to realize his altitude was insufficient when the aircraft struck the ground and crashed 8,3 km short of runway 02. At the time of the accident, the airport was closed and the approach light system was off. One of the passenger was the drug lord H\u00e9ctor Luis Palma Salazar who was later arrested.
