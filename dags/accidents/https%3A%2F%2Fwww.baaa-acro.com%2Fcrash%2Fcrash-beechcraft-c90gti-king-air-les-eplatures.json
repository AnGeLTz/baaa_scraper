During the takeoff roll on runway 24, the pilot-in-command realized that the aircraft' speed did not increase after 88 knots then dropped to 85 knots. He decided to reject the takeoff procedure and initiated an emergency braking procedure. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran and collided with concrete blocks and the ILS equipment. All four occupants were injured, two seriously. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by a collision with obstacles after the runway end due to a late take off run interruption decision, most probably due to an involuntary braking action on behalf of the pilot. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Poor pilot experience on this aircraft model.\r\n- Inadequate take off  configuration (flaps).\r\n- Initial multi engine training performed on a different aircraft model.\r\n- Pilot not familiarized with short runway."}
