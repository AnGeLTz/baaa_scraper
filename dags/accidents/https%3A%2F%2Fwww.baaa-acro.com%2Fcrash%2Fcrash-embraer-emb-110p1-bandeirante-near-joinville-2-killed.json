The JNV NDB beacon and the next PP NDB were selected by the crew to start the descent to Joinville Airport, with a minimum safe altitude fixed at 770 feet. After the aircraft passed over JNV beacon, the ADF system was unable to find the PP NDB as it was inoperative so the aircraft initiated a turn heading 051\u00b0 towards the PP beacon located near S\u00e3o Paulo-Congonhas Airport. The crew did not notice the change of heading and continued the descent when few minutes later, the aircraft struck a hill and crashed. Both pilots were killed.
