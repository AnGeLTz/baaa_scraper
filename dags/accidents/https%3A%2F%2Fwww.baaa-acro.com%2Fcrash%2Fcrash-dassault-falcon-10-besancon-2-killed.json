The crew initiated an emergency braking procedure but the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, stuck a 2,4 metres high embankment located 30 metres past the runway end and came to rest, bursting into flames. The passenger was seriously injured and both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a late decision by the crew to abandon the takeoff procedure completed with the parking brake not fully released. The following contributing factors were reported: \r\n- Imperfect application of the checklist, not allowing the crew identify the anomaly when starting up or rolling.\r\n- Bad weather conditions, which led the crew to concentrate on maintaining the runway centerline to the detriment of other checks, and make it impossible to see sufficiently early the landmarks likely to attract his attention to the insufficient acceleration of the aircraft.\r\n- The position of the \"BRAKE\" warning light outside the pilot's normal visual circuit while taking off."}
