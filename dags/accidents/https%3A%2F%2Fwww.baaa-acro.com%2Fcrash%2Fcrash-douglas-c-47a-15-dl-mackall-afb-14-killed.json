While approaching the drop zone at a height of 300 feet, the left engine failed. Due to low height, it was impossible for the paratroopers to leave the cabin so the crew decided to return to the base. On final approach, the aircraft was misaligned and the captain decided to go around and increased power on the right engine. The aircraft continued on a flat attitude and then banked sharply to the left. It hit tree tops, stalled and crashed short of runway. Six  occupants were rescued while all 14 others were killed.\r\nThe 4 crew members killed were:\r\n2nd Lt Richard A. Christian,\r\n2nd Lt Charles C. Hinson,\r\nCpt Leroy A. Listug Jr.,\r\nS/Sgt James McGarthy.", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the failure on the left engine was not determined with certainty. However, US Command noted that fuel contained in the tanks was a 91 octane fuel and it should be relevant to use a 100 octane fuel in the future."}
