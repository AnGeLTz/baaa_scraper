In the late evening, the crew was supposed to return to base. While cruising at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the crew was unable to locate Angle Bay due to the lack of visibility caused by the logical blackout. Short of fuel, the crew attempted to ditch the airplane that impacted the water surface and crashed in the Irish Sea. Six crew members were killed and five others took place in a dinghy and were later rescued. \r\nCrew:\r\nCpl Clifford Oswald William Amos, \u2020\r\nLAC Ralph Douglas Bell, \u2020\r\nAC1 John Charles Francis, \u2020 \r\nCpl Francis Hewitt, \u2020\r\nF/O Thomas Gracie Joyce, \u2020\r\nLAC Norman Raine, \u2020\r\nF/O V.
