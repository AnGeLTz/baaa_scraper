The student pilot stated the flight was normal until a 'violent right yaw' developed when the throttles were advanced to recover from a practice stall. As the cfi took over the controls and attempted recovery a 'substantial loss of power' occurred on both engines. A forced landing was made in a field during which the left wing contacted trees and the aircraft was engulfed in flames. Post accident examination of the left engine failed to disclose any discrepancies. Discrepancies were noted on the right engine.\r\n1) The fuel controller fuel line 'tee' fitting was cracked around 50% of its circumference. (ductile overload).\r\n2) The turbocharger gasket on the inlet side of the turbine showed leakage around 70% of the gasket are. The aircraft had a history of symptoms of fuel vaporization which subsided with use of the aux fuel pump as the engine manufacturer suggests. It is unknown if the aux pump was used during this accident.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (total) - mech failure/malf\r\nPhase of operation: maneuvering\r\nFindings\r\n1.
