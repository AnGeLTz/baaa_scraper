Then the crew started the takeoff procedure but shortly after liftoff, the airplane rolled to the left. Full right rudder and aileron failed to stop the roll, so the power was cut off on the right engine. The aircraft touched down and ran off the left side of the runway. The right main gear ran into soft dirt and folded back. While both crew members were unhurt, the aircraft was written off.
