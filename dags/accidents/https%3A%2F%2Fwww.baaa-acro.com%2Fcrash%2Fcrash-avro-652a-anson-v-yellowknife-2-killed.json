It then hit a building and crashed. Both crew members who were performing an on-demand cargo flight were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the total weight of the aircraft was 1,400 pounds above the MTOW. Investigations revealed that the aircraft was parked on the ramp for six days prior to the accident and the crew failed to deice the plane before departure. No deicing, defrosting or contaminent removal was performed prior to departure. In such conditions, the aircraft failed to gain height due to a loss of lift, loss of aerodynamic performances and a subsequent overload. "}
