Enroute, the airplane went out of control, went into a dive by an angle of 30\u00b0 and finally crashed into the Gulf of Aden, about 352 km east of Aden. Few debris were found but no trace of the ten occupants who were considered as deceased. The aircraft sank in relatively deep. It is believed that an engine failed in flight and that the crew mistakenly shot down the wrong engine. It is possible that the engine failure was caused by a lack of electric power due to the failure of a battery. Also, it appears that the cargo loading was completed against the published procedures and that the CofG was affected, which may contribute to the loss of control.", "probable_cause": null}
