While approaching the zone under fire at low height, the aircraft struck the ground and exploded. The aircraft was destroyed and both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the result of loss of control in a presentation turn at a very low height. This loss of control was the result of an overly brutal maneuver by the crew because the airplane's position at the start of the presentation was wrong. \r\nThe following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Excessive workload for the captain,\r\n- Different languages used between both flight crew members,\r\n- Operational practices at the S\u00e9cutiv\u00e9 Civile that left too much improvisation over the drop zone,\r\n_ Lack of visibility on short final."}
