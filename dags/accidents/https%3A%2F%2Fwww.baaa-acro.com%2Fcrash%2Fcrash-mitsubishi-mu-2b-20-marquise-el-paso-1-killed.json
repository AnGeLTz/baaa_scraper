He reported a large lighted area as being downtown El Paso when in reality it was most likely Coronado Hills, a development on the west side of Franklin Mountain located approximately 4 miles north of the south end of the mountain. This was probably due to having just descended from IFR conditions into VFR conditions. His familiarity with the area, combined with his method of flight operation (as related by a professional acquaintance), probably gave a false sense of security and overconfidence in his personal ability.
