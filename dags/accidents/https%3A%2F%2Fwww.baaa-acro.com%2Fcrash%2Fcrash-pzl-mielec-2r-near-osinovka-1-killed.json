Few minutes later, he encountered below-minima weather conditions and decided to return to Andreyevka but this was too late. Shortly later, while completing a turn in clouds at an altitude of 1,200 meters, the single engine airplane collided with the summit of a ridge located about 15 km northeast of Andreyevka Airport and crashed. Injured, the copilot walked down the mountain to find help. The captain was killed while all five other occupants were injured.", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain caused by wrong in-flight decisions on part of the captain. "}
