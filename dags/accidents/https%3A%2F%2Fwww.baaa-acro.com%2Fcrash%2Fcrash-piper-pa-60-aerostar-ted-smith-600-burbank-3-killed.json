After the pilot reported climbing through 2,800 ft msl, the radar controller observed that the aircraft deviated from the course and began to lose altitude. He attempted to communicate with the pilot, but was unable. Witnesses observed the aircraft maneuver in and out of the overcast. Two witnesses watched it change course to the right from southeast to northwest, pull up into the overcast, then dive out of the clouds in a near vertical attitude and crash. During an examination of the wreckage, no preimpact, mechanical failures were found. The aircraft was designed to be flown in instrument conditions from only the left front seat. Both occupants as well as one person on the ground were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: climb - to cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
