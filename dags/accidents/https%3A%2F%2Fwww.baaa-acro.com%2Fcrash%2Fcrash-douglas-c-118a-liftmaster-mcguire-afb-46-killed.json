Less than two minutes after takeoff from McGuire AFB runway 24, while climbing, the four engine aircraft encountered poor weather conditions, stalled and crashed in a dense wooded area located 1,4 mile from the airfield. Eight crew members and 38 passengers, among them civilians, were killed while 20 other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was reported that weather conditions were poor at the time of the accident with thunderstorm activity around the McGuire Airbase, a horizontal visibility of 1,500 meters, clouds from 600 to 1,800 feet and wind gusting up to 30 knots with turbulences. The assumption that the aircraft encountered strong downdraft caused by a micro-burst was not ruled out. "}
