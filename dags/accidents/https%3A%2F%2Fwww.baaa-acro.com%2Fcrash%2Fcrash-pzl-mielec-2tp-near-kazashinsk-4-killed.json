While in normal cruise, the crew informed ATC he was diverting to Yukhta for unknown reasons. Few minutes later, while flying in snow falls, the airplane struck trees and crashed in flames on the slope of a mountain located about 63 km north of Kazashinskoye. As the radio contact was lost and the airplane failed to arrive at destination, SAR operations were initiated but eventually suspended after few days as no trace of the aircraft nor the four occupants was found. The crew of an helicopter localized the wreckage on 21 June 1976. It was determined that the airplane struck trees at an altitude of 800 metres, got a little altitude then crashed 60 metres further in a forest. At the time of the accident, the visibility was probably below 2 km and below minimums. ", "probable_cause": "The decision of the crew to continue the flight in below weather minimums (snow falls) and not returning to his departure point. The accident was the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain. "}
