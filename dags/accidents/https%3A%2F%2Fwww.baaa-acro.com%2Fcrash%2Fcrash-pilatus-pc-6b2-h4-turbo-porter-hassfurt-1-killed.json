After the pilot leveled off at the assigned altitude, the first skydiver jumped out of the cabin. For unknown reasons, he struck the tail, causing severe vibrations. As the pilot was unable to maintain the aircraft control, all occupants jumped out and the aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent. During the dive, the left wing separated due to excessive g-loads and the aircraft eventually crashed in an open field. Seven people were rescued, among them three were seriously injured. One skydiver was killed and the aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": null}
