On approach to runway 31, flaps were selected down from 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 when the captain observed an asymmetrical condition between both flaps and decided to set back at 15\u00b0 and to continue the approach in such conditions. The aircraft landed hard to the left of the runway centerline and bounced twice. Out of control, it veered off runway, lost its right main gear and came to rest few dozen metres further. All 164 occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair as the left main gear punctured the fuel tank and the fuselage was deformed. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the asymmetrical flaps condition on approach is undetermined. Since all the conditions were clearly not met, the pilots should have made the decision to initiate a go-around procedure."}
