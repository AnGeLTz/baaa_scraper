Radar data showed that approximately 20 minutes before the accident, the aircraft began a gradual descent from about 10,000 feet. No preimpact part failure or malfunction of the aircraft, engine or autopilot was found. The pilot had a rest period on the previous day, but the investigation did not determine whether he had obtained any sleep before a 1700 pst flight. After the 1700 pst flight, he voluntarily flew on a late night flight with another company. That flight was delayed in returning and did not land at Ontario until about 0500 pst the next morning. Approximately 41 min later, the pilot took off on the accident flight.  ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: altitude deviation, uncontrolled\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
