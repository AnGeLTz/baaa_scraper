The crew informed ATC about the situation then lost control of the airplane that entered a dive and eventually crashed in the Sivash gulf, about 24 km southeast of Emelyanovka, Crimea, 10 km offshore. The airplane disintegrated on impact, the wreckage sank and all 26 occupants were killed. Refloat operations were conducted from October 24 till November 18, 1978. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft was flying in severe icing conditions since 15 to 20 minutes when both engines stopped quite simultaneously. The flying crew failed to follow the emergency procedures and the decision to activate the engine deicing systems was taken too late, a situation that caused the aircraft to become uncontrollable. Analysis revealed that air intakes, turbine blades and inlet guide vanes were covered by ice. The training program that refers to icing conditions was not satisfactory. "}
