On final approach, while at an altitude of 500 feet with the right engine out, the crew realized he could not reach the runway in such conditions. So the captain decided to make an emergency landing in a field but on ground, as the aircraft was unable to stop rapidly, he raised the undercarriage and the aircraft came to halt in flames. While both crew members were able to vacate the cabin quickly and were unhurt, the aircraft was destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": null}
