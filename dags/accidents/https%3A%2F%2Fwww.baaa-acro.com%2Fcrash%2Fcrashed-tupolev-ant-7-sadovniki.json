It took off from Myachkovo Airport around 0930LT. Some 15 minutes into the flight, weather conditions deteriorated and the pilot got confused due the limited visibility cause by rain falls. He reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing in a muddy field located near Sadovniki. Upon touchdown, the airplane lost its undercarriage and was damaged beyond repair. Both crew members were uninjured.", "probable_cause": "The decision of the pilot to attempt an immediate landing in an unsuitable terrain rather than returning to Myachkovo Airport. The lack of experience of the pilot in poor weather conditions remains a contributory factor as this created a confusion to him. "}
