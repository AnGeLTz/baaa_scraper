Due to fuel shortage, the crew attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft crashed in a desert area located 100 km southeast of Al Sarah (Majin al Ma`sarah). Upon landing, the aircraft lost its undercarriage and both engines before coming to rest, bursting into flames. All 10 passengers were rescued while all three crew members were killed.
