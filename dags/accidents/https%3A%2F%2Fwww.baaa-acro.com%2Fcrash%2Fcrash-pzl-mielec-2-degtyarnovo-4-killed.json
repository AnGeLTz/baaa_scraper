While cruising at a relative low altitude, the single engine airplane went out of control and crashed in flames in a wooded area located 2 km northwest of Degtyarnovo. The burnt wreckage was found in the evening and all four occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that all four occupants (both pilots, the mechanic and the passenger) were intoxicated at the time of the accident. The crew decided to embark a passenger at Sokolsky without prior permission and all of them consumed alcohol during all day and prior to departure. A lack of discipline, a high alcohol level in blood and a total distraction caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. The alcohol level was 5,4\u2030 by the captain, 2\u2030 by the copilot, 4,4\u2030 by the mechanic and 2,5\u2030 by the passenger. "}
