The aircraft was in fact seen on many other airports, Bratislava, Ostrava and Lubumbashi. At the time of the accident, the plane is understood to have had a long list of 32 faults that needed urgent repair. Problems included a limited EGT of n\u00b01 & 4 engines; n\u00b03 engine constant speed drive (CSD) gearbox was consuming a 'massive amount of oil'; n\u00b01 engine CSD generator missing; n\u00b02 engine required bleed on takeoff and above FL330; left wing leading edge cracked and leaking; n\u00b04 fuel tank and reserve tank gauge not working. Decision to ferry the aircraft to N'Djamena was taken on February 7. During the takeoff roll the n\u00b02 & 3 engines failed. The takeoff was aborted but the aircraft could not be stopped within the remaining distance. It overran, lost its nose gear and came to rest 200 metres past the runway end. All seven occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
