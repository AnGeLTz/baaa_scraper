After the cargo was unloaded and the aircraft was refueled, the aircrew aborted the 1st two attempts to takeoff due to slow aircraft performance. Engine run-ups were performed after each abort and reportedly, the engines checked normal. After the 2nd aborted takeoff, the aircrew called the fbo and requested that the refueler be asked what type of fuel was added. The response was '100LL Avgas.' On the 3rd attempt to depart, the aircraft took off, but both engines lost power as the landing gear was retracted. The aircrew selected a highway on which to land. However, the left wing hit a utility pole, then the aircraft went thru a fence and hit a highway embankment. Investigation revealed that Jet-A fuel had been added to the aircraft rather than 100LL fuel. The truck containing Jet-A fuel looked similar to the one with 100LL Avgas, but was properly designated with fuel grade markings. A pilot was killed, the second was seriously injured.
