He opened up the engines to go round again, but the aircraft failed to gain height. Veering to the right it flew a short distance with the starboard propeller rotating slowly until the starboard wing struck the ground, and the aircraft cartwheeled. The passenger cabin broke away from the main wreckage which caught fire. Both pilots were killed. The steward and all 7 passengers aboard were seriously injured. The accident occurred at 1416LT.", "probable_cause": "The accident was due to the malfunctioning of the automatic pitch coarsening unit of the starboard propeller. This deprived the captain of the necessary degree of control of the aircraft at a critical stage of the flight."}
