The takeoff was aborted and afterwards the pilot decided to ferry the aircraft to New Bedford for inspection. The engine were restarted and operation was good. The flight to New Bedford was without incident until the aircraft was on a two miles final to runway 05 at this time the left engine stopped while the pilot attempted to feather the engine, both the engine and part of the left wing caught on fire. The pilot continued to the airport with the flaps and gear down and a speed at 125 mph. The pilot stated he was in a good position to land when he heard a loud bang which he described sounded like a cable. The aircraft entered a 25\u00b0 left bank. He leveled the wings by reducing right engine power. Collision with trees to the left of the runway occurred afterwards. Examination of the aircraft disclosed that the left engine exhaust manifold header assembly, which is connected to the turbocharger, was cracked along a weld seam. Also revealed was that the aileron cables that are routed behind the left engine were burned to separation. Both occupants were injured.
