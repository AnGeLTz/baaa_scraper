During the takeoff roll in Warsaw, the aircraft's main gear hit a pothole in the ground. The gear broke and the aircraft came to rest upside down. While both crew members were uninjured, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. It appears that the pothole was caused by the recent heavy rain falls. It was 'repaired' few days before the accident but it seems that was insufficient. \r\nCrew:\r\nCaptain Georges Pelletier-Doisy, pilot, \r\nHenri Carol, mechanic.", "probable_cause": "Poor condition runway."}
