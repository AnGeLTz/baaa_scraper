During initial climb, at a height of 20 metres, the engine n\u00b03 lost power. The crew increased power on all three other engines and continued to climb. Less than 25 seconds laters, at a height of about 60 metres, the engine n\u00b01 failed. The captain attempted an emergency landing in a snow covered terrain located 660 metres past the runway end. The aircraft belly landed and came to rest with severe damages to the fuselage (almost broke in two at wings level) and engines. All 33 occupants were rescued, among them four were injured, two seriously.", "probable_cause": "The loss of power on engine n\u00b03 was the result of the rupture of a hydraulic line located near the rotor. This failure caused a reduction of the blades' rotation on both propellers (counter-rotating system), creating severe vibrations. The crew increased power on all three remaining engines when a technical malfunction occurred on an electric sensor coupled to the turbine of the engine n\u00b01, causing the automatic control unit to fail and the engine n\u00b01 to stop."}
