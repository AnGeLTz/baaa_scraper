Following several circuits, the crew started a night approach to runway 09 with a tailwind component. Apparently due to a wrong approach configuration, the airplane landed too far down the runway. After touchdown, the pilot feathered the propeller on two engines but the airplane was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, struck several approach lights and eventually came to rest in a pond located short of runway 27 threshold. All five crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": null}
