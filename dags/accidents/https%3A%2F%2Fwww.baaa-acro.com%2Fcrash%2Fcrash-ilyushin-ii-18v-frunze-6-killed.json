On final approach, both right engines n\u00b03 & 4 were shut down to simulate a double engine failure. While at 3,500 metres from the runway threshold at a speed of 300 km/h, the crew deployed the flaps at 30\u00b0 when the airplane entered an area of limited visibility (less than 1,500 metres). The captain decided to initiate a go-around and triggered both right engine. For unknown reasons, the engine n\u00b03 failed to restart. Due to an insufficient speed, the airplane banked right to an angle of 55-60\u00b0 then lost height and crashed in flames short of runway threshold. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all six crew members were killed.  ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of several errors on part of the flying crew which led the aircraft in a configuration that became uncontrollable. The instructor allowed a pilot under training to seat in the front left seat while his experience and capabilities were insufficient for such flight configuration. The crew decided to deploy the flaps at 30\u00b0 with both right engines not running, which caused the airplane's speed to drop to a critical value of 220 km/h. The decision of the crew to restart both right engines was too late. "}
