After the wind component changed, the crew decided to perform a straight-in approach to runway 08. The aircraft landed too far down the runway (427 meters past the runway threshold) and at a speed of 112 knots (Vref was 110 knots with a target touchdown speed of 103 knots). Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, plunged in the Beagle Canal and came to rest about 20 meters from the shore. 17 occupants were wounded and 35 other occupants escaped uninjured. 20 passengers were killed in the accident. ", "probable_cause": "Poor approach planning and wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who landed too far down the runway (1,440 meters long). The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Marginal weather conditions, \r\n- Unfavorable wind component as the crew landed with a 6 knots tailwind, \r\n- Wet runway surface and poor braking action."}
