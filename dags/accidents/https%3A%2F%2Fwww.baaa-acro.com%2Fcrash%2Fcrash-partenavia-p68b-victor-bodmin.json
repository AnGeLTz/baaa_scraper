The commander reported that the ground was soft and wet, with the grass surface longer than normal, and that no flap was selected. The flight manual for the aircraft stated that performance takeoffs should be carried out with 15\u00b0 flap selected. The aircraft failed to achieve sufficient airspeed to become airborne in the distance available, and overran the runway into an area of thick gorse and moorland. There was no fire, and both occupants, who were wearing lap and diagonal shoulder harnesses, were uninjured, and vacated the aircraft by the normal means. ", "probable_cause": null}
