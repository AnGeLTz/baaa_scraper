The wreckage was found few hours later and all 37 occupants have been killed. Apparently, the airplane was off course at the time of the accident, most probably due to a navigational error on part of the crew. ", "probable_cause": "Although the Japanese government aircraft accident investigation committee conducted a thorough investigation, it encountered some difficulty because of the rejection by the Occupation authorities of a request from the committee to provide a tape recording of instructions to the distressed aircraft from the Haneda Airport control tower. As a result, the accident investigation was closed with the aviation agency's report that the probable cause was the pilot's operational error."}
