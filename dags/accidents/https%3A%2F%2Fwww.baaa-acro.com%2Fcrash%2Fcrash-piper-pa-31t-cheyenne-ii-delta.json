After the turn, the baggage door came completely open, the left wing dropped immediately and the aircraft stalled. The pilot added full power and lowered the nose. When he raised the nose near the ground, the aircraft shuddered and crashed. Two rescue personnel, both certified pilots, arrived shortly after the accident and found the nose baggage door in the unlocked position with the bayonet pins retracted. A Piper representative stated that if the left side nose baggage door of a PA-31 opened in flight there would be the likelihood of an interruption to the smooth airflow through the prop, possibly reducing the thrust produced by the blades. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control in flight while maneuvering to landing area after the pilot failed to maintain flying speed. The following findings were reported:\r\n- Cargo door unlocked, \r\n- Inadequate preflight preparation, \r\n- Aircraft performances deteriorated, \r\n- Inadvertent stall by the pilot. "}
