While cruising in marginal weather conditions, the single engine aircraft hit with its right main gear the top of Mt Hor-Taiga (2,618 meters high) and crashed into a ravine. The flight engineer was killed while four other occupants were injured. Two of them walked away to find help and came back a day later to evacuate the other survivors. The navigator died from his injuries 16 hours later. The aircraft, brand new, was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was caused by a poor flight preparation on part of the crew and the combination of the following factors:\n- lack of crew training that failed to guarantee a sufficient flight safety level,\n- lack of pilot experience in conducting geophysical survey flights,\n- incomplet meteorological informations for mountainous terrain,\n- absence of a flight manual and procedures regarding aerial photography missions, \n- overconfidence on part of the navigator who had more than five years experience in this type of mission,\n- deterioration of weather conditions during flight."}
