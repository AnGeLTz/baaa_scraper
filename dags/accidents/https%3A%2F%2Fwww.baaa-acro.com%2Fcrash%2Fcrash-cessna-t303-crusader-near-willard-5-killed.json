He took off at 1804 pst. At 1814 pst, just prior to calling level at 13,000 feet, he reported he was encountering light turbulence and light rime ice. Approximately four min later, the pilot reported experiencing heavy vibrations. He requested and received a clearance to return to Portland and descend to 7,000 feet. Shortly after that, the aircraft entered a tight descending turn which the pilot reported he was having difficulty arresting. He reported regaining directional control at 6,000 feet and said the aircraft had a heavy load of ice. Shortly thereafter, the aircraft crashed in mountains at the 3,130 feet level. Due to damage from impact and wreckage retrieval, the preimpact condition of all deicing components was not verified. The aircraft was not certified for flight in known icing conditions. Moderate mixed icing condition and moderate turbulence were forecast. The pilot was briefed there had been reports of moderate icing thru-out the area. All five occupants were killed.
