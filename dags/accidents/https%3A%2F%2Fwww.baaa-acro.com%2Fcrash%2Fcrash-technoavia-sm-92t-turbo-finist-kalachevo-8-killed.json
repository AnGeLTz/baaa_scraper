Shortly after takeoff, while climbing to a height of about 100 metres, the aircraft stalled and crashed in a snow covered field located 1,5 km north of the airfield. The aircraft was totally destroyed upon impact and all 8 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a stall during initial climb due to the combination of the following factors:\r\n- Violation of the climb procedures regarding the speed,\r\n- Flight performances were not met as the aircraft was operated for skydiving purposes but not intended for such type of flight,\r\n- The total weight of the aircraft was above the MTOW,\r\n- The aircraft was not equipped with a system that could inform the pilot of the imminence of a stall,\r\n- The aircraft stalled at a relative low altitude that could not allow the pilot to expect recovery."}
