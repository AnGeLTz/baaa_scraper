After an uneventful fuel stop in Accra, the crew continued to Pointe-Noire but encountered poor weather conditions upon arrival. The visibility was bad and the ceiling was about 100 meters. On final approach, the aircraft was too far to the right of the centerline so the pilot in command made a sharp turn to the left when control was lost. The aircraft crashed in flames and was destroyed. All 18 occupants were killed, among them military personnel, civilians, women and children. \nCrew (Groupe de Transport GT I/25 Tunisie):\nLt Cornette, pilot,\nCpt Pinson, \nAsp Desgourgues, \nAdj Carayol,\nSgt Escudie, \nSgt Rivaud,\nSgt Cullion.\nPassengers:\nDr. St\u00e9fanopoulo from Pasteur Institute, \nCol Cordier, \nCdt Delair,\nMrs Sokoloff and her three children, \nMrs Lagrange.\nMrs C\u00e9cile Idrac  2.", "probable_cause": null}
