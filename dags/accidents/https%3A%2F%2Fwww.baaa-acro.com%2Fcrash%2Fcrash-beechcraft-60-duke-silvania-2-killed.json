As he started the descent to Goi\u00e2nia Airport, the pilot reported the failure of the left engine and requested the permission to proceed with a direct approach to runway 32 despite the runway 14 was in use. Few seconds later, the right engine failed as well. The pilote reduced his altitude and attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft crashed in an open field located near Silv\u00e2nia, about 50 km east of Goi\u00e2nia Airport. On impact, the fixing points of the seat belts broke away, causing both occupants to impact the instrument panel. The aircraft was severely damaged and both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of both engines in flight due to fuel exhaustion. The following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Poor judgment on the part of the pilot who considered that the quantity of fuel present in the tanks before departure was sufficient, which was not the case,\r\n- Poor flight planning on part of the pilot who miscalculated the fuel consumption,\r\n- The pilot failed to follow the procedures related to fuel policy.
