Seven minutes later, at 2306LT, the flight called Nashville and requested permission to climb to 8000 feet, which was approved. However altitude was lost until the DC-3 descended into the thickly wooded southern slope of a hill which rose to a height of about 75 feet. \r\nCrew:\r\nDale F. Dryer, pilot,\r\nWilliam J. Brand, copilot,\r\nMargaret A. Jewell, stewardess.", "probable_cause": "Inability of the aircraft to gain or maintain altitude due to carburetor ice or propeller ice or wing ice of some combination of these icing conditions while over terrain and in weather unsuitable for an emergency landing. The following was considered as a contributory factor: weather conditions which, had their nature been anticipated, should have precluded the dispatch of the flight in an aircraft no equipped with wind or propeller deicing equipment."}
