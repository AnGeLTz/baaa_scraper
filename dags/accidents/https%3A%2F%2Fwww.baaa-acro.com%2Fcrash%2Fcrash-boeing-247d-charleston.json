The pilot lost control of the airplane that stalled and crashed in a wooded area located near the airport. All nine occupants were injured and the aircraft was destroyed by impact forces. There was no fire. \r\nCrew: \r\nRussell J. Wright, captain, \r\nWilliam H. Riley, first officer, \r\nIrene Coates, flight stewardess.", "probable_cause": "Loss of power in the right engine due to causes unknown.\r\nContributing factors were:\r\n- Failure of PCA to establish adequate procedures to require its pilots to be familiar with the terrain surrounding airports, and failure of Captain Wright to familiarize himself adequately with the terrain surrounding the Charleston Municipal Airport.\r\n- Failure of PCA to inform its pilots of the amount of power which could reasonably be taken from Pratt and Whitney Wasp S1H1-G engines under emergency conditions, and the consequent hesitancy of Captain Wright to exercise his emergency authority and use additional power soon enough to clear the ridge."}
