The pilot said he used full power for takeoff but the takeoff was longer than normal. The da was computed to be 9,286 feet. After takeoff the pilot said he raised the landing gear but a witness disagreed. The flight then reduced power and as rpm was reduced, noted that the mp was only 24 inches. The aircraft began a descent which the pilot said could not be stopped with power so he landed gear down in a pasture. The aircraft collided with 2 ditches and a fence during the 1,500 feet roll. The engines were found to operate normally after the accident. All four occupants were injured, two seriously.
