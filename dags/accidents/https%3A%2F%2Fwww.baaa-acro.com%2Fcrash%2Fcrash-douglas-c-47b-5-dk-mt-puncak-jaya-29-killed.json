As it failed to arrive in Townsville, SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. The missionary Jerry Reeder discovered the wreckage with his Cessna 206 in June 1967. He had rented a vacant house to the DeLong Lumber Company that was doing a hardwood lumber survey in the area. Their superintendent, Mike Cramer, upon hearing about his discovery of a downed aircraft immediately made their Bell Jet-Ranger helicopter available to visit the site. The first attempt had to be aborted due to weather and a partial engine failure. They nearly crashed twice. But the next day they were able to spend two hours on the ground. They gathered three sets of dog tags and the pilot\\\\\\\\\\\\'s chart case which were turned into to the Australian Embassy in Singapore a month later. On December 10, 1970, walkers found the wreckage on the slope of a mountain located near Mt Puncak Jaya, southwest of Mulia, some 100 feet from the summit. It was later decided between Indonesian and Australian authorities to repatriate all remains back to Australia. This exercise was completed from May 23 to June 6, 2005. \r\nCrew (33rd Squadron): \r\nW/O Arthur Jack Hunter, pilot,\r\nW/O Albert Clifford Hughes, copilot,\r\nF/Sgt Kenneth Robert Wiles, wireless operator, \r\nW/O Eric Wilkinson, wireless operator,\r\nF/Sgt Allan George Sawrey,\r\nSgt Francis Leonard Henry Blackmore.\r\nPassengers:\r\nW/O Allan Campbell,\r\nLAC William Royce Dunderdale,\r\nF/O Noel Royce Stibbard,\r\nSister Marie Eileen Craig, \r\nPvt Keith John Bowden, \r\nPvt Laurie Anthony Coombe, \r\nGeorge Phillip Duffy,\r\nTrevor John Eiszele,\r\nPvt Mervyn John Ford,\r\nSgt Arthur John Hyde, \r\nFrederick Joseph Ireland,\r\nLt Alun Morris Jones,\r\nPvt Arthur Trevor Jorgensen, \r\nJames Francis MacDougall,\r\nRonald Leslie Mathieson, \r\nJonathan Matthews, \r\nPvt John McAlorum, \r\nPvt Ian Scott McDowall,\r\nPvt Leonard Thomas Oakley,\r\nPvt Ian Thomas Ray, \r\nPvt Donald William Smith, \r\nPvt James Ivan Tindall,\r\nCpl George John Welch.\n\r\nThanks to Jerry Reeder for his testimony.
