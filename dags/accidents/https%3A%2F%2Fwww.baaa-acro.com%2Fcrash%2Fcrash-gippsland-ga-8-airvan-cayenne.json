About three minutes into the flight, while cruising at an altitude of 1,500 feet, the plot encountered engine problems, declared an emergency and was cleared for an immediate return. The aircraft landed back at 1452LT. Some controls were performed on the engine and the aircraft took off again at 1507LT. Less than a minute later, the engine lost power. The pilot again declared an emergency and returned to the airport. On short final, the aircraft lost height and crashed in bushes some 800 metres short of runway 26. The passenger was seriously injured and the pilot was slightly injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of engine power during initial climb due to an abnormal wear of the cam lobes and tappets, for reasons that investigations were unable to determine. It is possible that pitting corrosion initiated this degradation which was not identified during the last periodic engine inspection."}
