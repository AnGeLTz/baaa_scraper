He set the parking and advanced the n\u00b01 throttle to 1,500 rpm until the engine warmed up. When both oil temperatures were within limits, he advanced both throttles to 30 inches manifold pressure and 2,250 rpm for a pretakeoff check. At that time, he used the normal (toe) brakes, since the parking brake would not hold the aircraft above approximately 1,700 rpm. He then applied full power and released the brakes for takeoff. As he started to roll with a slight left crosswind, the aircraft began drifting left. He corrected with right rudder, some right brake and right aileron. The aircraft then began drifting right and the pilot suspected a wind-shift from that direction. He applied left rudder and right aileron, but the plane veered right, went off the runway and headed for a ditch. Unable to stop, the pilot tried to clear the ditch. As the aircraft became airborne, the left wing dropped and hit the ground, and the aircraft yawed and crashed. The parking brake was found partially engaged. Tire marks were evident on the runway. All four occupants escaped uninjured. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - on ground/water\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - roll/run\r\nFindings\r\n1.
