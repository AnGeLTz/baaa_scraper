The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. The airplane departed from Scottsdale Airport (SDL), Scottsdale, Arizona, about 1412 and was destined for Winslow-Lindbergh Regional Airport (INW), Winslow, Arizona. No flight plan was filed and there was no contact with air traffic control during the flight. Radar tracking depicted the airplane accomplishing several turning maneuvers in the vicinity of the Winslow airport and general accident area at elevations ranging from 7,100 ft mean sea level (msl) to 4,850 ft msl for about two minutes before the radar track ends. The airplane came to rest in a rock quarry adjacent to Arizona State Route 87 about 4 miles east of the Winslow Airport. The entire airplane was contained within a flat portion of the quarry; the sides of the rock quarry were about 40 ft in elevation and surrounded the accident site. A postcrash fire consumed the wreckage. The first identified point of impact was a disturbance to the ground about 10 ft from a barb-wire fence; the wood posts were fractured, and the barbwire was pulled out, the two metal posts about 12 ft apart were not damaged or disturbed.
