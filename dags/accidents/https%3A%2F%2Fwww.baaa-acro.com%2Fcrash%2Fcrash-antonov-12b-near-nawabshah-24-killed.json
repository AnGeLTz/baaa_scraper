On the leg from Karachi to Tashkent, while cruising at an altitude of 5,500 meters, weather conditions deteriorated and the aircraft entered an area of hailstorm with severe turbulences. All four engine lost power and the crew was forced to shut down the engine n\u00b01 and 3 while the engine n\u00b02 and 4 were reduced to idle. The crew then initiated an emergency descent when the aircraft partially disintegrated in the air and crashed. It was determined that excessive g-loads caused several parts to detach during the emergency descent.
