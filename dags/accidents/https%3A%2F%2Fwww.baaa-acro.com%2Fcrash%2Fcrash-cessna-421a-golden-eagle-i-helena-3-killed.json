Investigation revealed that one VOR receiver was set on the destination ILS frequency, the second VOR was set on an en route VOR 51 nm west of the destination airport, and the DME radio, a separate transceiver, was set on the destination DME transmitter. The frequencies of the en route VOR and the destination VOR were 117.1 and 117.7, respectively. The outbound course for the ILS approach procedure was 088\u00b0 and the accident site was located on the 088 radial of the en route VOR.

The second VOR receiver control head was located in the lower right portion of the instrument panel, in a location where the selected frequency was difficult to read. All three occupants were killed.
