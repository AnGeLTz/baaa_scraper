The goal of the mission was to test the JATO propulsion system in case of an engine failure on the Antonov AN-8. For this test program, the aircraft was renamed AN-8RU version. Twenty seconds after takeoff, while climbing to a speed of 220 km/h, the JATO system was ignited. Six seconds later, once the speed of 264 km/h was reached, the left engine was voluntarily shut down. At this time, the crew was unable to feather the propeller that went into auto-rotation. The airplane banked left to a 70-80\u00b0 angle then dove into the ground and crashed in a field located 1,850 meters past the runway end. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all seven crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, the crew encountered difficulties, was unable to and/or forgot to feather the propeller on the left engine. This caused an asymmetric thrust and high drag which caused the aircraft to be uncontrollable and to crash."}
