The captain decided to divert to Krasnoyarsk Airport for an emergency landing. The approach was completed in snow falls and during the last segment, the four engine airplane was too low and struck the ground 200 meters short of runway threshold then crashed and burned. There were no casualties but the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the loss of hydraulic pressure on engine number 2 remains unknown. However, the decision of the crew to divert to Krasnoyarsk Airport was wrong as the weather was considered as marginal. It would be preferable to divert to Kemerovo or Bratsk Airport where the weather conditions were considered as good. "}
