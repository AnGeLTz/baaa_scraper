Prior to departure the pilot failed to visually inspect the amount of fuel in the right wing tank. The tank was full. The tank's cap probably appeared to be secured when, in fact, because of a unique design characteristic, it was merely resting on top of the filler neck. Upon takeoff rotation the cap came off the filler neck and it was followed by a fuel spray. The pilot responded and stayed in a very low altitude and close-in traffic pattern. He attempted to land immediately. He lost control during the turn to final, stalled and collided with the pavement prior to reaching the threshold. Both occupants were killed.
