At 2135LT, while flying at 9,000 feet some 60 miles off the Dutch coast, the Whitley was attacked by the pilot of a Me.110 and badly damaged. In turn, the enemy aircraft was claimed destroyed by AC1 Parkes. Despite a painful foot wound, F/L Raphael ditched the bomber and the crew clambered into the dinghy. Their plight was seen by F/L Crockett, who happened to be in the area at the time, and he was able to direct a Royal Navy destroyer to the scene. After four hours afloat, the crew were rescued and take into Yarmouth. \r\nCrew (77th Squadron):\r\nF/L G. L. Raphael,\r\nP/O R. P. Payne,\r\nSgt Prescott,\r\nLAC Storey,\r\nAC1 Parkes.\r\nSource: W.
