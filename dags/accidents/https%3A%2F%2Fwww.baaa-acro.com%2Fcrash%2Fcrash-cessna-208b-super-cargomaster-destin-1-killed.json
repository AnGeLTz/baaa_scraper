The pilot then requested a surveillance radar approach to runway 14, to be followed by a surveillance approach to runway 32, in the event of a missed approach from runway 14. The published approach minimums were 1-1/4 mile visibility, ceiling 460 feet msl (438 feet agl). The radar control observed an altitude readout that was below the published minimums and advised the pilot to execute a missed approach. No response was received from the pilot. The aircraft was found floating in the bay approximately 2 miles from the end of the runway. Another pilot (based at the same facility) stated that the two pilots had, on numerous occasions, attempted the approach at times when the weather was reported to be less than that required for the approach. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilots failure to follow instrument flight rules procedures by disregarding the minimum descent altitude for the approach and failing to maintain clearance from the terrain. A factor in the accident was the pilot's overconfidence in his personal ability."}
