While on base leg, the aircraft lost height and crashed in a sugar cane field located 2 km from the airport, bursting into flames. All 21 occupants were killed. It was later reported that the door of the forward baggage hold opened during takeoff. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a stall during approach while on the downwind leg base due to a loss of VMC at low altitude.\r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- Failure of the crew to manage the approach procedure (poor CRM),\r\n- Use of maximum flaps (42\u00b0),\r\n- Insufficient altitude,\r\n- Lack of coordination between crew members,\r\n- A possible state of fatigue of the captain,\r\n- A possible overweight aircraft,\r\n- The opening of the forward baggage hold door during takeoff."}
