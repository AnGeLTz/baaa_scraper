Following repairs, the crew (three pilots and two engineers) was engaged in a local test flight out from Khanty-Mansiysk Airport. While cruising at an altitude of 6,000 meters, the ailerons were deployed to an angle of 8,5\u00b0 then the aircraft turned to the right. Eight seconds later, it went out of control, overturned and entered a dive. With a rate of descent of 100 meters per second, the aircraft reached the speed of 620 km/h. With a positive acceleration of 5,25 g the left wing separated and struck the base of the tail that was torn off. The aircraft continued its uncontrolled descent until it crashed in an open field located near the Ob River, about 19 km northwest of the Khanty-Mansiysk Airport. The aircraft was destroyed and all five crew members were killed. The wreckage was found a day later.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the captain elected to perform a barrel in flight, in violation of all published procedures in force. "}
