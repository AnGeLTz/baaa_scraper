During that time, light freezing drizzle was falling, intermittently mixed with ice pellets and snow. The crew checked the aircraft surfaces from the cockpit and entry door, but observed no ice or snow adhering to the tops of the wings, nose section, windshield or above the door. The captain declined an offer to de-ice, two other aircraft were being de-iced. The takeoff was normal (18\u00b0 nose up attitude) until just after lift-off, then the aircraft entered an uncommanded left roll and both engines compressor stalled. The captain corrected with left aileron and rudder, then began aborting the takeoff. The aircraft touched down left of the runway on the tail skid and right wing tip, approximately 5,600 feet from the threshold and on a 070\u00b0 heading. It then traveled another 2,025 feet in a sweeping right arc, hitting 2 runway signs and came to rest heading west with the right pylon bent down. Investigations revealed a thin layer of ice (est 0.15 inch thick) would have been on the wings, raising the aircraft's stall speed. When DC-9-15 aircraft stall, engines are susceptible to compressor stalls.
