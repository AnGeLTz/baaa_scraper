The aircraft rolled left and crashed into trees. The aircraft's cockpit, cabin, engine nacelles, cargo and portions of the wings were destroyed by post-impact fire. Post accident examination of the aircraft revealed the landing gear was in the up and locked position and the flaps were at 30\u00b0. This is consistent with a go-around configuration. No mechanical malfunction/failure could be determined. The aircraft had a restricted category airworthiness certificate. The cargo area contained two fuel tanks and assorted items (oil stove, tools, 55 gallon drum and hoses). The pilot was type rated in this aircraft. The runway length listed in the Alaska supplement was 1,000 feet longer than the actual runway length. The runway was glazed with ice. Both occupants were killed.
