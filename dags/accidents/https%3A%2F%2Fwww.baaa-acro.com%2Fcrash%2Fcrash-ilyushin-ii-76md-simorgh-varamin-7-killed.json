While cruising south of the capital city, the crew declared an emergency following an engine failure and elected to return. During the emergency descent to runway 29L, the radome located on the roof detached and hit the tail. Out of control, the aircraft crashed in an open field located near Varamin. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all seven occupants were killed. It is believed that the radome detached because the aircraft' speed exceeded its certification during the emergency descent.
