During the takeoff roll from runway 34, the pilot-in-command started the rotation but the aircraft encountered difficulties to gain height. The nose gear and the cargo pod impacted an embankment located at the end of the runway and the aircraft flipped over and came to rest upside down. All five occupants escaped with minor injuries and the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft failed to gain sufficient speed during the last portion of the runway due to an excessive accumulation of sand on the ground. The pilot-in-command elected to rotate when the aircraft impacted terrain. \r\nThe two following factors were identified:\r\n- The pilot's ability to make a timely decision,\r\n- Lack of coordination between the two CRM (standard call out) pilots during takeoff manoeuvres."}
