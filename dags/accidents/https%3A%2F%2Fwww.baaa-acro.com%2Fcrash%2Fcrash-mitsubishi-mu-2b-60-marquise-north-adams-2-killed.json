He was issued a cruise clearance of 5,000 feet and given a heading. 18 miles from the airport he reported visual contact with the ground. At 1151 he was asked if he was familiar with the area to which he responded negative. He was then advised of rising terrain in all quadrants, including a mountain '...to almost 3,700 feet, three miles south of the airport.'
