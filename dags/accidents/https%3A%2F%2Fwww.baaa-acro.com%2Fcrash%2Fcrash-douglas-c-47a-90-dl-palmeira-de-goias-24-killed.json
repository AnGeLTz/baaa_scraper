The crew tried several times to extinguish the fire but without success. Eventually, the pilot-in-command reduced his altitude in an attempt to make an emergency landing when, at a height of about 20 meters, the airplane exploded in the air and crashed few km from the airport of Palmeira de Goi\u00e1s. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 24 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Investigators arrived on scene two days after the crash and confirmed that the wreckage was looted by locals. Due to the absence of evidence, it was very difficult to establish the exact cause of the accident. Nevertheless, it is believed upon the testimony of several eyewitnesses that a fire erupted in the rear of the cabin and not in the fuel tanks located in the wings. It is possible that the fire was caused by inflammable materials stored in the bagage compartment. The fact that the aircraft was not equipped with fire detectors was considered as a contributory factor as it took time for the crew to analyse and understand the situation.  "}
