The crew had checked out the location to see if a C-54 could land there for resupply operations. During the night frost had accumulated on the aircraft. The windshield was cleared, but the wings and stabilizer were not. At a weight of 28850 pounds, 850 pounds over the allowable gross weight, the pilot tried to take off. After becoming airborne the right wing dipped. The pilot recovered, but the main gear then touched the ground. The wheels and skis then hit a river bank. The C-47 bounced and came down on the right wing, sliding to a stop in a tail high position. The wreckage was still on the same location by 2005.\r\nMore details about this crash on \r\nwww.oldwings.nl/content/c47_yic/c47.htm", "probable_cause": null}
