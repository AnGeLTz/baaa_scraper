The airplane left Lisbon at 0952LT and Barcelona Airport at 1315LT. After an uneventful flight, the crew started the descent to Torino-Aeritalia Airport in poor weather conditions with clouds down to 400 meters and an horizontal visibility estimated at 1,200 meters. Due to the poor visibility, the pilot did not realize he was flying to low when the aircraft hit the Mt Superga (675 meters high) and crashed on the east wall of the basilica, about 12 km from the runway 28 threshold. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and all 31 occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nPierluigi Meroni, pilot,\r\nAntonio Pangrazi,\r\nCelestino D'Inca,\r\nCesare Biancardi.\r\nPassengers:\r\nValerio Bacigalupo, player, \r\nAldo Ballarin, player, \r\nDino Ballarin, player, \r\n\u00c9mile Bongiorni, player, \r\nEusebio Castigliano, player, \r\nRubens Fadini, player, \r\nGuglielmo Gabetto, player, \r\nRoger Grava, player, \r\nGiuseppe Grezar, player, \r\nEzio Loik, player, \r\nVirgilio Maroso, player, \r\nDanilo Martelli, player, \r\nValentino Mazzola, player, \r\nRomeo Menti, player, \r\nPiero Operto, player, \r\nFranco Ossola, player, \r\nMario Rigamonti, player, \r\nGiulio Schubert, player,\r\nArnaldo Agnisetta, director,\r\nIppolito Civalleri, director,\r\nEgri Erbstein, coach, \r\nLeslie Lievesley, coach, \r\nOttavio Corina, masseur,\r\nRenato Casalbore, journalist at Tuttosport,\r\nLuigi Cavallero, journalist at La Stampa,\r\nRenato Tosatti, journalist at Gazzetta del Popolo,\r\nAndrea Bonaiuti, organizer.", "probable_cause": "Navigational error on part of the crew who did not realize he lost more than 1,000 meters during the last minutes. This navigational error was attributable to the poor weather conditions that influenced the direction finder system. Poor visibility and lack of suitable assistance on part of the ATC were considered as a contributory factor. "}
