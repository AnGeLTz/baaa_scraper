He initiated a turn to land on runway 05 but was unable to line up with the runway. He elected to go-around and when he added full power the left engine oil pressure went to zero psi. The pilot feathered the left engine and a single engine go-around was attempted. The landing gear and flaps were not retracted and the aircraft crashed 2 miles northeast of the airport and was destroyed by post crash fire. The origin of the oil leak could not be determined due to the extent of the fire damage. The pilot, sole on board, escaped with minor injuries.
