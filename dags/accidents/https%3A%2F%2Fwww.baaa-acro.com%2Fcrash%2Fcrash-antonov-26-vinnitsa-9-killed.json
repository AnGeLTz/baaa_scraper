On final approach, the pilot-in-command descended to the MDA and as he was unable to establish a visual contact with the runway, he initiated a go-around procedure. Few minutes later, a second attempt to land was also abandoned. During a third attempt, the aircraft descended too low when the right engine struck trees. The aircraft stalled and crashed in a wooded area located near the village of Stadnytsya, about 5 km north of the airport. All nine occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": null}
