After touchdown on runway 10, the airplane encountered difficulties to stop within the remaining distance, overran, struck construction vehicles and came to rest in a construction zone. All occupants were evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that a fire erupted in the front baggage compartment for unknown reason. The reaction of the the crew to return was correct but the approach configuration was wrong with a too high speed upon landing. After touchdown, the crew failed to make profit of all braking systems and the airplane was unable to stop within the remaining distance. The presence of a work zone and construction vehicles was considered as a contributing factor. "}
