At an altitude of 300 feet agl the left engine began to surge and the right engine, according to the pilot, 'seemed to be delivering no power either and I could feel the plane decelerating.' The pilot stated he turned the aircraft to miss a housing development. A witness stated that the left wing dropped and the aircraft dove into the ground at about 45\u00b0 angle. Investigation failed to reveal any reason for loss of engine power. Both passengers were seriously injured and the pilot was killed.
