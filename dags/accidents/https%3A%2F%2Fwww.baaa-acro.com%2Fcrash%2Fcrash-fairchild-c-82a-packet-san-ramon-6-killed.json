After rotation, the undercarriage struck successively an embankment and a tractor parked 50 metres further. Out of control, the airplane crashed in a field and was destroyed. All six occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of the combination of the following factors:\r\n- The total weight of the aircraft at the time of the accident was above the MTOW for the existing flying conditions,\r\n- The crew encountered technical problems with the left engine prior to departure that was delayed several times. Thus, a malfunction of the left engine is suspected, \r\n- Both engines were not running during final impact,\r\n- The copilot and the flight engineer were not qualified on this type of aircraft."}
