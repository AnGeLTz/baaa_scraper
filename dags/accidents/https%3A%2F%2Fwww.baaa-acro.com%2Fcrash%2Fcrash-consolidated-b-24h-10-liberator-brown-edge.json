After take off from Warton, the crew could not raise the undercarriage. While attempting to resolve this problem, the aircraft started to bank to the left and lost height. The pilot stated that he assumed both problems to be associated and when he recovered the aircraft to level flight, he headed back to Warton. Shortly before landing, the flight engineer reported he had resolved the undercarriage trouble and the gear was raised so the crew set course bound for RAF Cheddington. After the undercarriage had been raised, the pilot noticed that the aircraft was still drifting to the left. Some time later, the aircraft was seen circling over the Biddulph area at low level and shortly afterwards lost height and struck a tree causing the number 3 engine to burst into flames. The aircraft crashed into a field not far away where it slewed though a 180 turn. Three crew members were injured while three others were unhurt. \r\nCrew (406th BG):\r\n2nd Lt Tommie F.
