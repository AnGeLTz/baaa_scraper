In the early morning, while completing a seventh low pass, at a height of about 20-40 metres, the pilot initiated a left turn when the aircraft descended to the ground and crashed at a speed of 140 km/h in an open field, bursting into flames. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Fatal accident with \u0410n-2 RA-33462 agricultural aircraft occurred during aerial works on crop-dusting and was caused most probably by the piloting error consisting in unintentional descent when performing a turn for the next crop-dusting round which resulted in the aircraft controlled flight into terrain.  \r\nMost probably, the following factors contributed to the accident:\r\n- The PIC not trained for crop-dusting flight without first officer,\r\n- The PIC conducting the flight with a passenger on first-officer\u2019s seat,\r\n- The presence of alcohol in PIC's and the passenger's bodies,\r\n- A possible transfer of the aircraft control from PIC to the passenger (former An-2 pilot) made by PIC,\r\n- Violations of An-2 AFM and FAR-128 requirements on maintaining heights, bank angles during turns and flight speed while crop-dusting,\r\n- Krasny Kut Civil Aviation Flight School management not controlling crop-dusting operations at the fields."}
