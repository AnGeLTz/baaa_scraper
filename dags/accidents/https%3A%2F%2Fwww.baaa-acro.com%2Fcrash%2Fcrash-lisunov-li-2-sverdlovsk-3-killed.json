The pilot in command lost control of the aircraft that banked right and crashed right wing first in a field located 8,5 km southeast of the airport, near the Iset River. Two crew members and the passenger were killed while three other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "The loss of control was the result of a series of mistakes on behalf of the crew who adopted poor flight techniques after departure. At the time of the accident, weather was marginal with severe icing conditions. It was stated that the crew was inexperienced, especially the copilot, which remains a contributing factor. The inefficiency of the windshield deicing system and a lack of crew training were also considered as contributing factors."}
