The pilot then began a rapid pull-up and both wings separated just outboard of the engine nacelles. Reconstruction of the sequence from a videotape revealed that the aircraft's speed at the time of the wing separations was 220 knots. Vne for the aircraft is 193 knots. It was calculated that, at 220 knots and an 8\u00b0 nose-up pitch, the 'g' load at the time of the wing separations would have been 8.3 g's. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
