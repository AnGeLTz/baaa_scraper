An Asiana Boeing 747-400 (HL7414) was taxiing to gate N6 for a refueling stop on the flight Seoul - New York (flight 211). While trying to make a U-turn, the Boeing's n\u00b01 engine struck the wing of the Ilyushin. Then the left winglet struck the base of the Ilyushin's tail. The Asiana crew added more power causing the wing to cut through nearly half of the tail of the Russian aircraft. The maximum ground speed recorded by the on-board recorders was 16 knots, while according to the company flight manual it should have been \"10 knots or below (5 knots if wet or slippery)\".", "probable_cause": "The excessive taxi speed by the pilot of the other aircraft. A factor associated with the accident was the other pilot's inadequate maneuver to avoid the parked airplane."}
