Before departing, flight was cleared for right turn after takeoff to 020\u00b0. Takeoff began at 0441:11. Water/methanol injection was used (to 1st power reduction). At 0441:49, landing gear was retracted; 8 seconds later 1st power reduction was made, then a frequency change was approved. Captain noted they should climb to 1,500 feet msl (approximately 500 feet agl) before turning. At about 300 feet agl, aircraft entered overcast and began a steep right turn. CVR indicated captain was performing cockpit duties at this time and giving info to f/o about the departure. FDR showed aircraft reached max alt of 423 feet agl and began descending. At 0442:22, captain remarked to f/o, 'don't go down . . . Get up . . . Up up up . . . Up, oh!' At about that time, aircraft hit in an open field, but continued flying for approximately 3/4 mile. It then hit a tree and crashed in a wooded area. Investigation revealed that during several training flights and 2 check flights, the f/o demonstrated difficulty in performing instrument flight due to disorientation, narrow focus of attention, or lack of instrument scan (instrument fixation), especially during high task workload. Both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Improper IFR procedure by the first officer (copilot) during takeoff, his lack of instrument scan (improper use of flight/navigation instruments), his failure to maintain a positive rate of climb or to identify the resultant descent, and the captain's inadequate supervision of the flight. Contributing factors were: dark night, low ceiling, drizzle, the first officer's lack of total experience in the type of operation, and possible spatial disorientation of the first officer. \r\nOccurrence #1: in flight collision with terrain/water\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff\r\nFindings\r\n1.
