Following a wrong approach configuration and several errors, the crew continued the approach at a speed of 183 knots, causing the aircraft to land too far down the runway, nose gear first. Upon touchdown, the captain released the tailchute that burst immediately due to high speed. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran and eventually crashed in the Etang de Berre. The wreckage sank by a depth of four meter and all 44 occupants were quickly rescued, four of them were injured. \r\nPhoto via https://www.azfleet.info/", "probable_cause": "The committee believes that the accident resulted initially from an incorrect procedure for the approach, bringing the plane in contact with the runway at abnormally high speed (more than 60 knots over the normal speed calculated and known by the pilot). This situation was further aggravated by the release of the parachute at an excessive speed and due to an inappropriate use of the emergency brake."}
