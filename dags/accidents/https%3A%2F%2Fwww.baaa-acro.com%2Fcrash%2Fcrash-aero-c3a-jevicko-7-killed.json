In the afternoon, both crew were instructed to stay at Prost\u011bjov due to poor weather conditions. At 2230LT, the headquarter informed both crew they were able to fly back to Chrudim as the weather improved. En route, both airplanes went out of control and crashed in the same time. S-11 crashed in a field northwest of Jarom\u011b\u0159ice while S-15 crashed in a wooded area located on km southwest of Jev\u00ed\u010dko. All 14 crew members on both aircraft were killed. \nCrew:\nJi\u0159i Kola\u0159,\nJan Pavli\u010dek, \nFranti\u0161ek Hoffmann,\nJan Machalek, \nFranti\u0161ek Kral,\nBartolomiew Jurec,\nZd\u011bnek Kola\u010dek.", "probable_cause": "At the time of the accident, weather conditions were marginal with the presence of a cold front. Both aircraft went out of control at the same time, apparently due to downdraft, turbulences or weather factors. According to the Czech Authorities, it seems unlikely that the fall of both aircraft is the consequence of a collision in flight. Analysis on S-15 revealed that the aircraft hit the ground at high speed, nose first (angle down to 75\u00b0) without its left wing."}
