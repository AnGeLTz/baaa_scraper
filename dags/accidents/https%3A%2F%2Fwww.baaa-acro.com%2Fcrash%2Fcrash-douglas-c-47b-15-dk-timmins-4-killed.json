This was not possible as the weather worsened at Winisk as well so the crew returned to Timmins and initiated a second approach despite the visibility was below minima. On final, the aircraft was too low and crashed three km short of runway threshold. Both pilots and two passengers were killed while four others were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot made inadequate pre flight preparations for a flight into known marginal weather. The pilot descended below the minimum altitude. The pilot exposed himself and his crew to the effects of fatigue by attempting a flight after a long period of duty.\n"}
