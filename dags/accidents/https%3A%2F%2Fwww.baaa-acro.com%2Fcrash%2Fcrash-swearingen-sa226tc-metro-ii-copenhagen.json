The crew was able to feather the right propeller but the nose gear failed to deploy. Manual recycling was ineffective and the crew continued the approach. The aircraft landed on its nose, rolled for few dozen meters and came to rest on the main runway. Both pilots escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the right engine caused by the failure of the turbine assembly retention guide vane. This caused a reduction of the hydraulic pressure, preventing the nose gear to be lowered. "}
