The left main gear signal appears to remain red. The captain obtained the authorization to make two low passes over the airport then ATC confirmed that all three gears were down. The final approach was completed at low speed and after touchdown, while braking, the left main gear collapsed. The aircraft veered off runway to the left and came to rest some 2 km past the runway threshold. All five crewmen were unhurt while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Cracks as result of fatigue caused the fracture of the hinge arm of the left main gear strut. The cracking most likely occurred as result of corrosion that remained undetected during the last maintenance inspection. The origin of pitting could not be identified, the investigation however identified deficiencies in the maintenance task conducted during last overhaul of the gear strut. Incomplete maintenance documentation and tools available during overhaul contributed to the accident."}
