The pilot-in-command initiated an immediate takeoff when the left wing struck the Stratotanker. On impact, both airplanes caught fire and exploded. While all three crew members on board the 707 survived, both technicians on board the KC-97 were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that ATC cleared the mechanics of KC-97 to cross the active runway when they had just allowed the TWA crew to take off from the same runway. It was determined that the time elapsed between both clearances was too short and that ATC failed to pay sufficient attention to potential traffic. Lack of coordination and poor visibility due to the night were considered as contributing factors."}
