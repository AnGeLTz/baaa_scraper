Shortly thereafter he went out solo to practice steep turns. He climbed to 12,500 feet and leveled off. He then rolled into a 60\u00b0 left bank at 200 knots airspeed by applying left aileron and back pressure. He then applied moderate left rudder. At this time the nose came up, the right wing came over the top, the nose tucked down and the aircraft entered a steep nose down spin. In his attempt to stop the spin the pilot shut down both engines. He got the spin stopped after 15 to 20 turns. He started pulling the nose up and the stall buffet was felt. Alt was 500 feet agl at this time and he was unable to restart the engines. He then made a gear up landing in a pasture which resulted in destruction of the aircraft. The pilot was uninjured.
