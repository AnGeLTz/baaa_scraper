Then, its altitude fluctuated and it descended and climbed again. Suddenly, the aircraft hit tree tops, lost some wing's and empennage elements while all engine cowlings separated. The fuel tanks were spoiled and the aircraft caught fire. It overflew the wooded area for a distance of 120 metres then impacted a powerline before crashing in an open field located 275 metres after the initial impact, bursting into flames. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by a collision with trees due to an inadequate flight path after takeoff in weather conditions that not allow a VFR flight. An irregular and intermittent operation of an engine probably focused the attention of the pilot to the engine to the detriment of the flight path."}
