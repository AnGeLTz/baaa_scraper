Subsequently, the airplane descended and the fuselage and left propeller contacted the water. With these problems and decreasing visibility ahead, the pilot elected to make a 180\u00b0 turn. He said that about midway through the turn, the #2 engine lost all power. The airplane then crashed into trees and was destroyed by a post-impact fire. No reason was found for either engine to lose power before water or tree contact. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the pilot to maintain adequate altitude after becoming distracted with an engine problem. Factors related to the accident were: loss of power in the #2 engine for an unknown reason and the low overcast condition."}
