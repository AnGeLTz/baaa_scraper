The airplane followed different circuits at an altitude between 1,000 and 3,000 meters when control was lost over the Constance Lake. The aircraft went into a spin and crashed into the lake about 4 km off Romanshorn. The wreckage sank by a depth of 200 meters and only few debris were found on water and on the bank between Romanshorn and Arbon. All nine occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "Thorough investigation of the ,wreckage revealed no evidence of any technical malfunction. On impact with the water the aircraft was in the following configuration:- undercarriage fully extended; flaps retracted; trim position impossible to determine; right propeller not feathered; twin RPM indicator showed left engine - 1 550 RPM, right engine - 1 350 RPM. The accident is attributed to the stalling of the aircraft following loss of airspeed, whereupon it unintentionally went into a spin. In view of insufficient altitude, it was not possible to level off the aircraft."}
