As the aircraft was being vectored on final approach, the pilot reported that he believed the aircraft had fuel starvation. Subsequently,  the aircraft was observed to make a complete roll and crash in a residential area. Only about 1.5 gallon of fuel was found in the right wing tank. The left wing and fuel tank were destroyed, but no odor of fuel was noted on the ground around the left wing. Also, a lack of fuel was noted in the fuel lines. The aircraft had not been refueled after the previous flight. The pilot that had flown the aircraft on a previous flight estimated there was 100 lbs of fuel remaining in each tank after his flight.
