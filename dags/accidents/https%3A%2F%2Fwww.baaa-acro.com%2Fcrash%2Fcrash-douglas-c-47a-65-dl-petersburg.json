While maneuvering the aircraft the pilot's control wheel became free, and he elected to ditch using full rudder and differential power. Examination of the pilot's control wheel aileron control chain revealed that the chain failed due to overload. The right seat was occupied by a mechanic employed by the operator and held a private pilot certificate with single and multi engine rating. He stated that he suggested to the pilot that his controls were functioning normally, but the pilot disagreed and proceeded to ditch the aircraft. Examination of the right control yoke revealed aileron movement in the correct direction.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper decision to ditch the aircraft when it could have been flown back to the airport using the right seat controls. Contributing factor(s) was: the failure and separation of a portion of the right aileron fabric, and the pilot's excessive force applied to the control wheel which resulted in overstressing the aileron control chain."}
