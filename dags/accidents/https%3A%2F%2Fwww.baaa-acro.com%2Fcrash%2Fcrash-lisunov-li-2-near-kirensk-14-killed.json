While descending into clouds, the aircraft hit the slope of a mountain located 117 km east of Kirensk. The wreckage was found few hours later and ten survivors (three crew members and seven passengers) were evacuated while 14 other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It appears that the aircraft was off track by 70 km to the southeast at the time of the accident due to a navigational error on part of the crew. It was reported that this navigational error was caused by poor piloting methods on part of the crew who decided to start the descent to Kirensk without knowing his exact position. The lack of visibility due to clouds was considered as a contributory factor. "}
