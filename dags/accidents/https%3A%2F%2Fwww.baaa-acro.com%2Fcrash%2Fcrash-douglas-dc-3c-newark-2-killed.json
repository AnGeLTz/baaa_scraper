The airplane was too far to the right for an approach to runway 06 and the tower controller radioed that he was in line for an approach to runway 28. The approach was then made to runway 28 which is 7,100 feet long with an additional usable 500 feet at the end. The approach was fast, however and contact was not made with the runway until within the last 2,000 feet. The aircraft continued off the runway and ran into a drainage ditch where a fire broke out, which was quickly extinguished.\nSource: \nhttps://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19470504-0\n", "probable_cause": null}
