Unfortunately in doing so, the pilot misjudged his height and struck the top of one of the ship's masts, carrying it away, and damaging the tail and rudder of his aircraft. After jettisoning its petrol, the plane made a belly landing on the island. The crew were uninjured and were taken to Sharjah the same days by launch. The airplane was later declared as written off.\nSource: \nhttp://www.adias-uae.com/publications/hellyergarey04.pdf", "probable_cause": "Poor judgement on part of the crew. "}
