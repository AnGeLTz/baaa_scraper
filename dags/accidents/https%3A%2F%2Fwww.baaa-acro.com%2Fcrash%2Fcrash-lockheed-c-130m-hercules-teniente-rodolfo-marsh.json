After touchdown at Teniente Rodolfo Marsh-Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Airport, the right main gear collapsed, causing the propeller of the engine n\u00b04 to detach. The airplane came to rest on a snow covered runway and all occupants escaped uninjured. The airplane was later parked on the apron and repairs were initiated. Eventually, in early 2017, it was decided to scrap the airplane which was destroyed on site. All debris were placed in a container and later shipped back to Brazil.", "probable_cause": "Failure of the right main gear upon landing for unknown reasons. "}
