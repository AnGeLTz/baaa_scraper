He stated that the right engine immediately had a partial loss of power. He stated that he did not attempt to raise the landing gear nor the flaps following the loss of engine power, and the aircraft would not maintain altitude. Examination of the aircraft engines revealed that there was rotational scratching of the turbine housings on the right engine, and no rotational scratching on the turbine housing of the left engine.", "probable_cause": "The poor inflight decision by the pilot in command in that after a partial loss of power, he shut down the wrong engine, did not follow the emergency checklist, did not raise the flaps, and did not retract the landing gear. A factor in the accident was the inflight collision with birds during the takeoff climb."}
