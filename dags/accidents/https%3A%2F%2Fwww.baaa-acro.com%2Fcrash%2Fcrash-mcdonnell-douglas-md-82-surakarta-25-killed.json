The approach was continued and after touchdown on runway 26, the crew started the braking procedure and activated the thrust reverser systems. ON a wet runway, the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, lost its undercarriage and slid for few dozen metres, collided with equipments of the localizer antenna, a fence and came to rest in a cemetery. Both pilots and 23 passengers were killed while 70 other occupants were injured. 68 occupants escaped unhurt. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The following findings were identified:\r\n- About 3 mm of water was stagnating on the runway surface, reducing the braking action, \r\n- The crew completed the landing procedure with a 13 knots tailwind component, \r\n- Airbrakes deployed after touchdown but retracted few seconds later due to wrong position of the power levers, \r\n- Power levers were not in idle position after touchdown but slightly forward, so the flight computer increased power,\r\n- Heavy rain falls, \r\n- The crew failed to initiate a go-around procedure.
