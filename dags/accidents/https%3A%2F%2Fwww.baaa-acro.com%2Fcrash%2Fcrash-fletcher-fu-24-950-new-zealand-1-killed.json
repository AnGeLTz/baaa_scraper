While flying at low height, the aircraft struck with its left wing a pine, lost height and crashed on the northern face of a ridge. The pilot was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The lone pine tree which the aircraft struck was probably obscured due to the position of the sun and shadow, making it difficult for the pilot to detect. Damage to the aileron control system resulted from the collision, and prevented the pilot from turning away from the ridge he had been sowing. Due to the impaired controllability the pilot was unable to recover from a steep left-banked turn, and the aircraft stalled and collided heavily with the face of the ridge in a nose-down attitude. "}
