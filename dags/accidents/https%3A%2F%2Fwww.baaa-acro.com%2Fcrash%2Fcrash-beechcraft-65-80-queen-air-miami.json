The flight was cancelled due to a problem with the left engine. On the day of the accident, the other person told the pilot that the engine was repaired and they proceeded to conduct a local test flight with the other person conducting the takeoff from the left seat. They reportedly switched seats prior to landing. The approach appeared normal until just prior to landing. A burst of sound from the engines was heard and the aircraft yawed and rolled left. The left wing impacted the ground and the aircraft cartwheeled. The last logbook entry was in 10/82. The owner could not be located. The other pilot could not be located and there is no record of him being issued a pilot's certificate. During teardown of the left engine the servo fuel injector was found rigged extremely lean at the idle stop.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (total) - mech failure/malf\r\nPhase of operation: approach - VFR pattern - final approach\r\nFindings\r\n1.
