While approaching the target area by night at an altitude of 1,000 meters, the aircraft was attacked by the German anti-aircraft artillery. The crew attempted three times to approach the zone, without success. Eventually, the captain decided to leave the area and continued to the east, climbed to an altitude of 2,600 meters, henceforth flying in clouds. As the crew lost his orientation and as the fuel reserve was low, he decided to attempt an emergency landing when the aircraft crashed in a wooded area located about 55 km from Bereznik. Twelve crew members were unhurt, the pilot, copilot and one marine were injured and the flight mechanic was seriously wounded. He died from his injuries three days later. ", "probable_cause": null}
