During the initial climb, at a height of some 30 feet, the Skytrain hit tree tops located 0.9 mile from the runway end, stalled and crashed in a wooded area, near the shore of the Missouri River. A passenger was seriously injured while 23 other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "According to investigators, both engines suffered a sudden loss of power during the initial climb, likely due to the fact that spark plugs were not compliant with the engine manufacturer procedures. Moreover, experts believe that a sudden increase in oil consumption resulted in excessive dilution of the fluid."}
