As the weather was iffy, all passengers tickets were canceled but the crew has to deliver the mail. The airplane departed Portland-Swan Island Airport at 1015LT bound for Eugene. Approaching Eugene, the crew encountered marginal weather conditions with low clouds but was able to land without further problems. After the mail was deplaned, the crew was cleared for takeoff. Following a normal takeoff run, the pilot-in-command initiated the rotation when the right engine failed. The airplane stalled, collided with a runway light and eventually crashed onto a vacant house. All three crew members were injured, both pilots seriously. The following day, they both died from their injuries. The aircraft named 'Dawson' was destroyed.\r\nCrew:\r\nHarold Adams, pilot, \u2020\r\nKenneth Householder, copilot, \u2020\r\nCornelia Pederman, stewardess.
