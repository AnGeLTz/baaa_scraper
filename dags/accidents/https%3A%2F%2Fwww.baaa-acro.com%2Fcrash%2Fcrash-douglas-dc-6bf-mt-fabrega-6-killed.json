While cruising in limited visibility, the aircraft struck the slope of Mt F\u00e1brega (3,335 meters high) located in the west part of Panama, near the border with Costa Rica. As the aircraft failed to arrive at destination, SAR operations were initiated but eventually abandoned few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the six occupants was found. The wreckage was found by walkers on 19 August 1989 at the altitude of 2,800 meters, more than 500 meters below the summit. \r\nCrew:\r\nWilliam Gross Robles, \r\nRicardo Tadeo Czarski, \r\nMarvin Jos\u00e9 Arana, \r\nJuan de Dios Morales, \r\nJuan Francisco Pav\u00f3n,\r\nJos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ch\u00e1vez.", "probable_cause": null}
