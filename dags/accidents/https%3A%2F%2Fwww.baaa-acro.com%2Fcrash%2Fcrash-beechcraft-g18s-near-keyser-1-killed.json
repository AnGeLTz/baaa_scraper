No record of a preflight weather briefing was found. However, during a telephone conversation prior to the flight, the pilot indicated to his manager that the clouds would be lower in the mountains. At approximately 1030, ground witnesses observed an aircraft, matching the description of N215W, circling beneath the clouds at Keyser, WV, then depart to the southwest. When the aircraft did not arrive at its destination, a search was begun. It was found where it had impacted rising terrain approximately 6 miles southwest of Keyser. The impact occurred on a 26\u00b0 slope, at approximately the 3,000 feet level, just below a 3104 feet peak. The aircraft was climbing when it impacted wooded terrain. A pilot/mechanical, who operated an airport approximately 3 miles southeast of Keyser, reported there was fog in the morning hours with a ceiling of about 2,000 feet until midday and that the mountain tops in the vicinity of the crash site were obscured. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. \n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight encounter with weather\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
