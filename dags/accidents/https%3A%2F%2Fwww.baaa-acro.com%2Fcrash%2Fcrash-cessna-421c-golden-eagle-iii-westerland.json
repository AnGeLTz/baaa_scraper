At a distance of 30 km southeast from Westerland-Sylt Airport, at an altitude of 1,300 feet, the pilot was cleared for an approach to runway 24. Few seconds later, both engines lost power. The pilot declared an emergency and was cleared for a straight-in approach to runway 33. Due to the situation, the pilot attempted to ditch the aircraft two km offshore. Rescue teams arrived on site about 45 minutes later and the pilot was rescued while the aircraft sank. The pilot added 250 litres of fuel at Hamburg Airport and a total of about 400 litres were found in all tanks after the wreckage was recovered, dismissing the possibility of a fuel exhaustion. Traces of corrosion were found on several engine parts.", "probable_cause": null}
