The wreckage was found few hours later, about 20 meters below the summit, and all 30 occupants have been killed. At the time of the accident, the visibility was nil due to heavy snow falls and the crew was unable to distinguish the mountain.\n", "probable_cause": "After takeoff from Sofia Airport, the crew was supposed to follow a circuit of 15 km around the capital city to gain the minimum altitude of 1,500 meters before proceeding to the northeast. Apparently to save time and fuel, the crew decided to ignore this procedure and proceeded directly to the northeast after departure, causing the aircraft to approach the mountain range at an insufficient altitude. Low visibility caused by poor weather conditions was considered as a contributory factor. "}
