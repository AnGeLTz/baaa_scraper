After rotation, it encountered difficulties to gain sufficient height when it successively collided with the airport perimeter fence and an embankment located about 150 metres from the runway 30 threshold. The aircraft crashed and was totally destroyed by a post crash fire. All five occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew failed to proceed to a proper inspection prior to departure and did not realize that the aircraft (wings, tail and fuselage) was contaminated with frost. This caused the aircraft to be unable to gain sufficient height after rotation as the aerodynamic properties were altered. The fact that the total weight of the aircraft was above the MTOW and the CofG was near the permissible limit was considered as a contributing factors. "}
