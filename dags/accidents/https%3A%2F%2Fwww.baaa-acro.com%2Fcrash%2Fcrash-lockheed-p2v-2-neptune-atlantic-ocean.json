The captain decided to return to Hamilton (Bermuda) for a safe landing but twenty minutes later, the right engine backfired while the manifold pressure increased to 20 inches. In such conditions, he decided to shot down the engine and feathered its propeller. Less than an hour later, while flying at an altitude of 3,000 feet, the left engine started smoking and lost oil. The crew eventually decided to ditch the aircraft near the weather station 'Echo' located in the Atlantic Ocean, east of the Bermuda archipelago. The aircraft sank and was lost while all ten crew members were rescued and evacuated by the crew of the USCGC Coos Bay. ", "probable_cause": "Double engine failure. "}
