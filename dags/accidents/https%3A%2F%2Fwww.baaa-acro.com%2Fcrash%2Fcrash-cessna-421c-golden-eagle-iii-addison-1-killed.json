He feathered the engine, diverted back toward the airport and descended to VFR conditions below the clouds. At 1448, the pilot said he had the airport in sight and turned onto a left downwind for runway 15. Reportedly, he extended the landing gear and began a left turn toward the runway. Reportedly, the aircraft was too close in and/or the pilot chose to make a right turn away from the airport to land. Witnesses lost sight of the aircraft during the turn due to low  clouds or obstructions. The pilot lost sight of the airport for a short time, then relocated it, but said he had his 'hands full.' Shortly thereafter, the aircraft entered a steep descent, hit the edge (roof) of a building, crashed into a utility pole and the ground and burned. There was evidence the aircraft was inverted just before impact. An exam of the left engine revealed evidence the #6 connecting rod had failed from oil exhaustion. Only one cup of oil was found in the engine and it had a history of high oil consumption. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
