Following a wrong approach configuration, the aircraft landed too far down the runway (about half way down) and was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, lost its undercarriage and came to rest 250 metres further. All three crew members escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who landed the aircraft too far down the runway, causing the landing distance available to be insufficient. As the landing was obviously missed, the crew failed to initiate a go-around procedure. Also, it was reported that the braking action was poor due to the presence of puddles and potholes in the runway surface."}
