From 1528 to 1533 PST, radar data showed that the aircraft was level at 4,600 feet on a heading of 330\u00b0 at 180 FTS ground speed. Radar info showed that the aircraft then entered a descent. During a 24 seconds period, the aircraft descended to an altitude of 4,100 feet msl and its heading changed 10\u00b0 to the right. The last radar position, 12 seconds later, revealed an additional heading change of 150\u00b0 to the right, accompanied by a descent to 2,300 (9000 from descent). Witnesses saw the aircraft descending at high speed in a right turn with the engines at high power. Just prior to impact, the right bank angle and nose low attitude increased. The aircraft crashed in a steep nose down, right wing low, attitude. No preimpact, mechanical malfunction or failure was found. No autopsy was made, only a gross exam of the pilot's fragmented body was possible. Before departing San Jose, the pilot had remarked that he was bothered by a bad cold.
