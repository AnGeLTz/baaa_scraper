While flying at a height of 50-60 meters, the pilot-in-command initiated a sharp turn when speed dropped. The airplane stalled and crashed in flames in an open field located about 7 km northwest of Kichma. It was destroyed by a post crash fire and both occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "The loss of control that occurred during a sharp turn was the result of the action of the pilot-in-command who caused the aircraft to adopt a super critical flight attitude after reaching an excessive angle of attack. Lack of flight control and poor flight planning were considered as contributing factors."}
