About two hours into the flight, the occupant spotted a fire. All five fire bombers were dropped with their materials in two groups. Then the crew increased engine power and continued at an altitude of about 150-200 metres. The engine oil temperature started to increase and reached 150\u00b0. Five minutes later, the engine failed. The crew attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft impacted 20 metres tall trees, stalled and crashed in a wooded area. The wreckage was found south of Kezhma, some 126 km east of Kodinsk. All four occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident with An-2 RA-40646 aircraft occurred during the emergency landing on a forest. The landing was due to inadvertent in-flight engine shutdown caused by destruction of bronze filling of hub 62.06.02 of master rod big end of crank mechanism. Most probably the destruction of hub bronze filling was caused by manufactured flaw consisting in a lack of bronze adhesion with steel base on the part of a surface."}
