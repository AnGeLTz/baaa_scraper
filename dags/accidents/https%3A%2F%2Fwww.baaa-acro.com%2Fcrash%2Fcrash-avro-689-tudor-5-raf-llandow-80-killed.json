On final approach to RAF Llandow, at an altitude of 150 feet, the pilot increased power and the aircraft climbed to 300 feet and then adopted a 35\u00b0 nose-up attitude. Out of control, it stalled and crashed in a field located 2,500 feet short of runway 28 threshold. All five crew members and 75 passengers were killed. Only three passengers were rescued, placing this tragedy as the most dramatic plane crash up to date. ", "probable_cause": "The loading conditions of the aircraft which gave a centre of gravity position too far aft and outside the limit in the relevant Certificate of Airworthiness and therefore insufficient elevator control under conditions of low speed and acute instability. Also, the pilot in command, aged 25, did not have sufficient experience, which was considered as a contributory factor. "}
