The airplane departed Burgas Airport at 1901LT and en route, the captain decided to divert to Plovdiv where weather conditions were considered as better. First radio contact with approach control in Plovdiv was established at 1950LT and the crew was cleared to descent. Twelve minutes later, while descending by night and limited visibility, the airplane struck the slope of a mountain located in the Rhodopes Mountain Range, near the city Smolyan. The wreckage was found few hours later about 56 km southwest of Plovdiv Airport. All 35 occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the first radio contact was established with a civilian controller at 1950LT. Four minutes later, this controller was relieved by a military controller who cleared the crew to descent without knowing the exact position of the airplane that descended below the minimum descent altitude. The lack of visibility was considered as a contributing factor. "}
