While cruising at an altitude of 30,000 feet, the aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a near vertical attitude. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The copilot probably gave his place on board to a passenger without any qualification to operate the aircraft, moments after takeoff. During the en-route flight phase, a failure of the primary pitch trim system was simulated by the activation of the secondary system, which would have resulted in an abnormal operation of the system, followed by violent loss of altitude and over speed condition."}
