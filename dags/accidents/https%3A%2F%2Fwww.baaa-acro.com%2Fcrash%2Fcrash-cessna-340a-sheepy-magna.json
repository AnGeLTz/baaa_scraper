The pilot attempted to identify and rectify the problem by checking the magneto and the fuel pumps switches and changing fuel tanks but, being unsuccessful, transmitted a 'mayday' message to Birmingham ATC. The pilot selected the landing gear down and then, despite some difficulty in finding a suitable field in which to make a forced landing and clearing some trees on the final approach, landed in a field of mature wheat. The aircraft came to rest with all three landing gear legs collapsed and the occupants left the aircraft through the normal passenger door.
