Subsequent to full stop landing on runway 25, takeoff checklist was recited. PIC commenced takeoff on runway 07. Check pilot simulated V1 engine cut after liftoff. PIC was unable to accelerate to V2, climb, or maintain directional control. Aircraft levelled off, air speed began to decay and aircraft drifted to the right. Check captain failed to take control or terminate engine cut simulation as evolution deteriorated. Aircraft collided with ILS glideslope tower marked by red obstruction lights. Loss of control followed when right wingtip/aileron separated. Aircraft then impacted ground and slid to a stop. Takeoff flap position should be 1/4. Both flaps found near 1/2 flap extended position. Handle found in 1/2 flap detent. Performances charts show aircraft able to reach V2 at 50 feet altitude in 6,500 feet roll, then +575 fpm climb (vyse) at acc wt.
