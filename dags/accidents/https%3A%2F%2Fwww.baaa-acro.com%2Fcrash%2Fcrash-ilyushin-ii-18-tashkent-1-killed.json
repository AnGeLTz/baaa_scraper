The captain decided to abandon the takeoff procedure and started an emergency braking maneuver. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran at a speed of 100  km/h, went through a road and a ditch before coming to rest, broken in two. 20 passengers were injured, three of them seriously as they were not wearing their seat belt. Few hours later, one of them died. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the engine n\u00b04 failed after colliding with birds during the takeoff roll, causing the high pressure turbine to fail. Several errors on part of the flying crew contributed to the accident, such as a wrong decision on part of the captain, his lack of knowledge about the time needed between the engine full power mode and the activation of the reverse mode. Also, the thrust reverse systems were activated on both left engines only as the flight engineer failed to activate the thrust reverse system on engine n\u00b03. "}
