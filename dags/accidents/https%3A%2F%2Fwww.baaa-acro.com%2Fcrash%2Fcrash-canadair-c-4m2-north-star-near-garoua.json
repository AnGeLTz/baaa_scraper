As the official documentation could not be obtained via the Dutch Authorities for exportation to Africa, the crew flew from Rotterdam to Birmingham, UK before continuing to Spain. While in cruising altitude over Cameroun, the crew lost his orientation and was unable to locate his position with certainty. Due to fuel exhaustion, all four engines stopped and the captain decided to attempt an emergency landing. A belly landing was completed in a prairie and while contacting ground, the airplane broke into four pieces before coming to rest. All four crew members were rescued. It was reported the crew failed to obtain the appropriate charts to fly over West Africa. ", "probable_cause": "Emergency landing caused by fuel exhaustion. "}
