The plane was attacked by two Soviet MiG-15's (Maj A. Z. Bordun and St/Lt L. M. Dimchenko) and was severely damaged. Two of the engines on the left side had been shot up and were no longer operating. The crew managed to creep home to Johnson AFB (Iruma AFB). Upon their final approach for a crash landing the nose of the aircraft suddenly dove into the ground. Upon crashing, the plane split in half and the wings crashed over the front section, killing all but one occupant of the cockpit. The lone survivor from the cockpit was Harry Lavene who had been the tail gunner. While being attacked, military records shows that he was the first enlisted man to shoot down a MiG-15 from a B-29.\nSource: \nhttp://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_serials/1944_4.html", "probable_cause": null}
