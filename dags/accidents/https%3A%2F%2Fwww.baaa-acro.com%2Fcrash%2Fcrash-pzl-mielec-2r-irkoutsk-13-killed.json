While climbing to an altitude of 270 meters in limited visibility, the AN-2 collided with an Aeroflot AN-12B registered CCCP-12985 that was carrying seven crew members who were performing a local training flight. Following the collision, the AN-2 went out of control and crashed in flames 200 meters further. All 13 occupants were killed. The crew of the AN-12 elected to make an emergency landing when the aircraft crash landed in a prairie located 3,980 meters past the runway end. It slid on the ground for 220 meters before colliding with a concrete mast that cut the airplane in two. All seven crew members escaped uninjured.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the collision was the consequence of wrong decision and poor planning on part of ATC acting in the tower at Irkutsk-Magan Airport. Lack of visibility was considered as a contributing factor."}
