Approaching Samarovo, weather conditions deteriorated with snow falls reducing the visibility below one km. The pilot overflew Samarovo without any visual contact and continued until weather conditions improved. At this time, the pilot decided to return to Samarovo despite the fact that the weather was still bad. Approaching from the north, he attempted to land in a pasture when he lost control of the airplane that crashed 15 km north of Samarovo. All seven occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot deliberately decided to return to Samarovo for landing despite poor weather conditions. \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- The weather bulletin transmitted to the pilot was expired and did reflect the actual weather conditions at destination, \r\n- Absence of control points on the route Tobolsk - Samarovo, \r\n- The pilot's lack of experience and training in instrument flights."}
