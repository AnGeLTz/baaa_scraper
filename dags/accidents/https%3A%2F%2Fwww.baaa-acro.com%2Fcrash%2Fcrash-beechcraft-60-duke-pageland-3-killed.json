As it crossed the northeast end of the runway, it initiated a right turn to cross the runway about the midpoint to a position for a left downwind for landing on runway 5. Its altitude was estimated to be about 200-300 feet above the ground and the landing gear was down. The witness did not observe the airplane further. It collided with the ground about 0.4 miles from the threshold. The morning sun was about 10\u00b0 above the horizon and was about 33\u00b0 to the right of the runway centerline. It would have been in the pilot's face during his flight from the last departure point. The landing runway sloped upward from the landing threshold. The lower-than-normal traffic pattern, the sun's position in relation to the airplane flight path, and the runway slope could have caused the pilot to perceive his altitude as being higher than it actually was. All three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with terrain/water\r\nPhase of operation: approach - vfr pattern - base leg/base to final\r\nFindings\r\n1.
