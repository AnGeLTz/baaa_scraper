While approaching Dakar just before sunset, the crew started an approach to runway 01 after declining an ILS approach to runway 30. The approach was abandoned due to low visibility caused by poor weather conditions and the captain decided to follow a holding pattern, waiting for an improvement of the weather conditions. Shortly after 0641LT, the crew started a second attempt to land on runway 01 but after reporting downwind at 0647LT, the airplane disappeared in a rain squall and crashed into the sea some 2,400 meters off the Mamelles lighthouse. The airplane sank by a depth of 40 meters and few debris and dead bodies were found about two hours later. All 63 occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nLucien Boirre, pilot,\r\nJean Roze, copilot,\r\nEug\u00e8ne Schuller, radio operator,\r\nJean-Camille Baty, mechanic,\r\nLouis Meleder, mechanic, \r\nGenevi\u00e8ve Sabourin, stewardess,\r\nFran\u00e7ois Quiret, steward, \r\nAlbert-\u00c9mile Guepratte, steward.", "probable_cause": "Due to lack of evidences and to the fact that the aircraft was not equipped with flight recording systems, investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the accident.
