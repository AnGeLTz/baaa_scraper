The crew attempted to restart the right engine without success and pilots were unable to feather the propeller. Due to high drag, the aircraft lost height and at an altitude of 8,000 feet, all occupants decided to bail out as the minimum safe altitude for the region was set at 9,000 feet. Out of control, the aircraft dove into the ground and crashed in a valley near Lovelock. Fourteen occupants were found alive while one crew member (Pfc George E. Johnson) was killed as his parachute did not open properly.", "probable_cause": "Engine failure."}
