Shortly after takeoff, while climbing to a height of about 150-170 metres, the engine started to vibrate. The captain attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft crash landed in a marshy field located 4,9 km from the airport, coming to rest upside down. All four occupants escaped uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a total engine failure during initial climb for reasons that could not be determined. The fact that the field was waterlogged and did not permit a safe landing was considered as a contributing factor."}
