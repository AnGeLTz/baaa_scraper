Few minutes later, while descending to the altitude of 12,300 feet in poor weather conditions, the three engine aircraft struck the slope of Mt P\u00e1ramo Frontino located about 85 km northwest of Medell\u00edn-Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova Airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 132 occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, the visibility was poor due to clouds, mist and rain. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain after the crew mistakenly initiated the descent prematurely, causing the aircraft to descend below the minimum prescribed altitude. It was established that the crew reported to be over the Abejorral NDB while in fact, the aircraft did not reach already this beacon. Thunderstorm activity probably influenced some instruments and the RNG VOR was out of service since few month following a terrorist attack. "}
