The engine failed shortly after takeoff. The crew elected to return to the airstrip when the aircraft lost height and was shifted by strong wind towards a fuel depot. At a height of 15 meters, the left lower wing collided with the roof of a diesel storage tank n\u00b034, then the aircraft crashed into tank n\u00b039 and exploded. Both pilots were killed. The aircraft was totally destroyed by a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "Due to the fact that the aircraft was totally destroyed, it was not possible to determine the exact cause of the accident. Nevertheless, it is believed that the engine failed in flight due to tar deposits because the spark plugs partially failed. Also, erroneous actions on part of the crew during an emergency situation may contribute to the accident. "}
