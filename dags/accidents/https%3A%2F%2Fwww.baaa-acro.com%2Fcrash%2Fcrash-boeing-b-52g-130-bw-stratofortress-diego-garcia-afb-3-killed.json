Three crew members were able to bail out while three others were killed as they ejected too late. \r\nCrew:\r\nCpt Kevin Kent, pilot,\r\nCpt Jeffrey Love, copilot,\r\nSgt Steven Ellard, gunner,\r\nCpt Jon Jeffrey Olson, radar navigator, \u2020\r\n1st Lt Jorge I. Arteaga, navigator, \u2020\r\n1st Lt Eric D. Hedeen, EWO. \u2020\n", "probable_cause": "The problems started with an electrical malfunction on preflight with a main tank fuel gauge. The decision to take the aircraft with the initial fuel gauge problem was compounded by failures in crew coordination, crew management, and failure to follow procedures when further malfunctions occurred, and a cascade of errors compounding initial minor errors in judgment and procedures.  The aircraft crashed because multiple engines ceased operating as a result of fuel starvation with over 30,000 lbs of fuel still on board the aircraft."}
