The aircraft was not refueled after arriving some 36 hours previously on a flight to collect supplies. It had been standing out in the open in heat for some 16 hours with a possible built up of fuel fumes from leaky tanks or lines. The aircraft suffered an explosion from an electrical short, within the fuselage, causing a fire that consumed the aircraft.
