Following an uneventful flight at an altitude of 2,750 meters, the crew started the descent to the airbase of Szentkir\u00e1lyszabadja located southeast of Veszpr\u00e9m when he was informed by ATC that the visibility was limited to 1,000 meters at destination due to fog. The captain informed the rest of the crew he would continue the approach until the minimum altitude of 100 meters and will perform a go-around manoeuvre in case he would not have the runway in sight. On final approach, the visibility decreased to 500 meters and the pilot-in-command realized that the radio-altimeter showed 20 meters so he decided to make a go around when the airplane struck the ground 500 meters short of runway 34 threshold. The airplane bounced and then crashed in flames 200 meters further. All 23 occupants were injured and evacuated, four of them seriously. Few hours later, the radio operator died from his injuries. \r\nCrew:\r\nMaj Old\u0159ich Prchal, pilot,\r\nMaj Franti\u0161ek K\u00e1\u0148a, copilot,\r\nMaj Anton\u00edn Piskl\u00e1k, flight engineer, \r\nLt Jan Hyn\u0161t, radio operator, \u2020\r\nMaj Vlastimil Pal\u00e1n, technician. \r\nSource: www.leteckabadatelna.cz/havarie-a-sestrely/detail/636/", "probable_cause": null}
