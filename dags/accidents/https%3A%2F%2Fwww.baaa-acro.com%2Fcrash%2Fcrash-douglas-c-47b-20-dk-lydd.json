The copilot overcorrected, causing the aircraft to swing right, leaving the runway at an angle of 20\u00b0 partially airborne. The left wing then scraped the intersecting runway 14 while maneuvering to avoid a windsock mast ahead. The aircraft touched down and skidded to a stop. An oil fire broke out in the right engine. All three occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
