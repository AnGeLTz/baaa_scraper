The aircraft successively flew over Normandy, Vosges and Belfort when the crew lost his orientation by night and in poor weather conditions. Instead of flying bound to the east for Stuttgart, the pilot continued to the south bound for Switzerland. When it arrived at the border between France and Germany, the bomber was attacked by the pilot of a German fighter Messerschmitt Me.110G. The aircraft caught fire but the crew was able to continue for few minutes before the aircraft went out of control and crashed in a prairie located in Le Chaumont, southeast of Saignel\u00e9gier, Jura, Switzerland. Six crew were killed while the seventh occupant was later rescued. He was able to bail out with his parachute when the aircraft was at a height of some 1,000 meters. \nCrew (57th Squadron): \nSam Atcheson, pilot,\nAnthony McCall, navigator, \nSergeant Jack Greenhalgh, armourer\nSergeant Brian Thomas, engineer, \nSergeant Frank Weaver, radio, \nSergeant James Naylor,\nSergeant Kenneth Reece, gunner, the only survivor.\nSource: www.retrotrame.ch", "probable_cause": "Short down.
