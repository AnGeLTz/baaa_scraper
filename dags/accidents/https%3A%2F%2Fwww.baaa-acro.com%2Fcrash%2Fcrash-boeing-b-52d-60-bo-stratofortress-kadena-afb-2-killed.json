During the takeoff roll on runway 05L, the captain decided to abort the takeoff procedure for unknown reason. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the airplane overran, traveled down a grass embankment, hit a large ditch and came to rest on Kadena AB inner perimeter road, sitting on top of an air force police pick-up truck. The wings were torn loose releasing fuel from the wing tanks. Fires started from ruptured hydraulic lines, fuel flowing over hot brakes, and from electrical malfunctions. The aircraft was a total loss and all seven crew members were rescued. Two of them, seriously injured, died on November 26 and November 28.\r\nCrew:\r\nCpt William 'Billy' Dilworth, pilot,\r\nCpt Gary B.
