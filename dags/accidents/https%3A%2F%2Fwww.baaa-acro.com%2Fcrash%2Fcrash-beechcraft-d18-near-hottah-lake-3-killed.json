In unknown circumstances, the aircraft crashed near Hottah Lake, in the region of Great Bear Lake, some 300 km north of Yellowknife. The nurse and a patient were killed while the pilot and the second patient, a boy aged 14, were injured. As the pilot suffered broken bones, the boy helped keep him alive by building a fire and shelter. The pilot resorted to eating flesh from one of the dead passengers while the boy abstained. About three weeks after the accident, the boy died of hunger and cold. On December 7, 1972 a Hercules on a routine mission picked up the ELT of the crashed plane. Shortly after two rescue specialists were dropped but unfortunately only the pilot was still alive.", "probable_cause": null}
