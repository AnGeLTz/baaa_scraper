However, he did not make the radio call until approximately 3 minutes later. The aircraft broke out of the weather at about 1,000 feet and 1 mile from the airport (before the radio call). At that time, the runway lights were not on. The captain then advised the FSS to turn on the runway lights and he made a left pattern to circle back and land. During the next approach, the aircraft was high and fast on final approach and touched down long. The 1st officer recommended that the captain make a go-around, but the captain elected to continue the landing. When the captain realized that he would not be able to stop on the remaining runway, he retracted the gear. The aircraft then slid off the end of the runway, went over an embankment, became airborne for about 140 feet, then impacted in a large ravine area. The weight manifest was found to be in error. After allowing for a 500 lb fuel burnoff, the landing weight was estimated to be 14,668 lbs. The max gross weight limit was 14,500 lbs. All three occupants were injured.
