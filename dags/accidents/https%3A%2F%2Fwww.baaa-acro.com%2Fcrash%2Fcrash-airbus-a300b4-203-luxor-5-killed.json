Following a wrong approach configuration, the pilot-in-command landed too far down the runway, about 700 meters past the runway threshold and to the right of the centerline. After touchdown, the right main gear struck runway lights. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, collided with the localizer antenna, went through a fence and came to rest, bursting into flames. The aircraft was destroyed and all five occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration. "}
