At liftoff, the twin engine airplane struck a fence located past the runway end and despite the situation, the pilot continued departure. Few minutes later, at an altitude of 11,800 feet, the pilot encountered downdrafts/updrafts and lost control of the airplane that crashed in a canyon located few miles from the airport. The wreckage was found two days later. A passenger was killed while six other occupants were seriously injured.
