The copilot was in command and the airplane was too high on approach so the captain took over controls and steeped the approach. Nevertheless, the aircraft was still too high over runway 19L threshold when it encountered severe downdraft. It nosed down and struck the runway surface nose gear first. It bounced, veered off runway to the left, rolled to the apron and eventually collided with a parked Fokker F27 Friendship 200MP of the Nigerian Air Force registered NAF908. Both aircraft were destroyed and one of the pilot on board the Twin Otter was killed, all eight other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew lost control of the airplane upon landing after the wind suddenly changed from 270\u00b0 at 10 knots to 360\u00b0 at 50 knots. Also, windshear was suspected. "}
