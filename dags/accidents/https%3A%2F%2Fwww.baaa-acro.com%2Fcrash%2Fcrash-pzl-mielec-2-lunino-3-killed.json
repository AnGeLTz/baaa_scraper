The AN-2 registered CCCP-35083 departed three minutes later on the same routing with one passenger and two pilots on board. For unknown reason, the crew of CCCP-35083 wanted to reach the first crew so they accelerated and joined the first aircraft about 20 minutes later. Due to poor judgement, the engine of CCCP-35083 struck the base of the tail of CCCP-35082. Out of control, it nosed down and crashed inverted in an open field located near Lunino. The airplane was destroyed and all three occupants were killed. The other aircraft was able to land without further problem.
