The crew declared an emergency and the captain decided to attempt an emergency landing on the Hamburg - Kiel Highway. On touchdown, the airplane slid for several yards, struck a concrete bridge, lost its wings and tail. It veered to the left and came to rest in flames, broken in two after the cockpit separated. A crew member and 21 passengers were killed while all others occupants escaped, 45 of them were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the engine failure was the consequence of a problem that occurred on the cooling system. Investigations were able to determine that the tanks coupled to this cooling system should normally be filled with water. However, as a result of a handling error, these tanks were filled with Jet A1. As a result, the engines could not be cooled properly, overheated and failed during initial climb."}
