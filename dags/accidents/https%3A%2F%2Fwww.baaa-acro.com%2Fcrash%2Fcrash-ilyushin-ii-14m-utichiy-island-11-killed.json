En route, weather conditions deteriorated and the decision to return was taken too late. While cruising at an altitude of 140 meters in limited visibility, the crew initiated a right turn in a slight climb when the airplane struck the slope of a hill (152 meters high) located in the southwest part of the Utichiy Island (Shantar Islands), in the west part of the Okhotsk Sea. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and all 11 occupants were killed.

At the time of the accident, flying conditions were difficult with thunderstorm activity, heavy rain falls and turbulences. "}
