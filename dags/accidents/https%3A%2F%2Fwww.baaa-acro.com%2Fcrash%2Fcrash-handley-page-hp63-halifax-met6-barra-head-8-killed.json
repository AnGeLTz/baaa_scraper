While cruising southeast of the Hebrides Islands, the four engine aircraft went out of control and crashed into the sea about 24 km southeast of Barra Head. SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. On January 16, 1951, the body of the captain and some debris were found by fishermen. It is believed that the loss of control may have been caused by a sudden in flight fire. \r\nCrew (202nd Squadron):\r\nS/L Terence Anthony Cox, pilot,\r\nP/O Donald Nattriss, copilot,\r\nSgt Edward Arthur Keeble, \r\nSgt John Frederick Stanley Black, \r\nF/Sgt John Henry Cobbold,\r\nSgt William Richard Martindale, \r\nSgt Stuart Gordon Purches, \r\nSgt Gerald Walklate.", "probable_cause": null}
