In the early evening, while returning to the airport, the twin engine airplane went out of control, entered a dive and crashed in a wooded area, bursting into flames. The wreckage was found near Karege, about 35 km northwest of Dar es Salaam Airport. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all three crew members were killed. The instructor totalized 5,295 flying hours with 446 on type. Both other pilots totalized 300 flying hours with 20 on type and 296 flying hours with 16 on type. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, it was reported that the loss of control occurred when the power lever of the left engine was in idle position while the reverser on the left engine was activated at the same time. Thus, investigators does not rule out the assumption that the pilot attempted to commit suicide. Also, the assumption that the crew lost control of the airplane following a sudden and violent fire on the right engine was also not ruled out."}
