After engine startup, the power was reduced to idle after someone inadvertently pulled out the circuit breaker. The aircraft jumped the chocks and started to roll. Since the engine's power was in idle, the brakes and the nosewheel steering system were inoperative. The crew elected to reduce power on the left engine but mistakenly increased the power on the right engine by 90%. This caused the aircraft to rotate 80\u00b0 when control was lost. The airplane rolled through a perimeter wall, causing the nose gear to collapse. All five occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
