The pilot decided there was sufficient fuel aboard to complete the next flight to the Washington National Airport, so he departed on that flight. However, about 21 mikes from his destination, he declared a low-fuel state and requested vectors to the nearest airport. Vectors were provided toward Davison Army Airfield. However, both engines subsequently lost power from lack of fuel and the aircraft crashed in a wooded area approximately 500 yards short of runway 32. The aircraft was destroyed and both occupants were seriously injured.
