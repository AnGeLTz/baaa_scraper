The passengers were respectively 23 Marines from the Naval School of Saint-Mandrier, four officers and the Director of the Naval School's house. All four crew members were attached to the Groupe 3/64 Bigorre at \u00c9vreux AFB. All of them were invited at Mont-de-Marsan Airbase to assist to the final of a radiophonic tournament they lost on semi-final. At 0100LT on November 25, the airplane departed Mont-de-Marsan Airfield bound to the east. En route, the crew encountered very bad weather conditions with fog and rain falls, reducing the visibility to zero. In such conditions, the crew failed to realize his altitude was too low when the airplane passed over the hamlet of La Sicarderie at a height of 150 meters. Less than 30 seconds later, the airplane struck trees and crashed in flames in a wooded area located in the Somail Mountain Range, about 40 km northwest of B\u00e9ziers. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 32 occupants were killed. \r\nCrew (Groupe 3/64 Bigorre from \u00c9vreux AFB):\r\nCpt Philippe Le Goff,\r\nSgt/C Robert Sonier,\r\nSgt/C Jean-Claude Bezanger,\r\nSgt/C Serge Luckel. \r\nPassengers (accompanist officers):\r\nCpt Raymond Faucher,\r\nMrs Elisabeth Boissat, Director of the GEM House,\r\nEns/V Francis Coinsin,\r\nAsp Louis Rimbaud,\r\nM/Pr Luc Kuntz.\r\nPassengers (Marines members of the Bagad du Groupe d\u2019\u00c9coles de M\u00e9caniciens (GEM) de Saint-Mandrier):\r\nM/Mec Pierre Nadal,\r\n2nd M/Mec Jo\u00ebl Quentel, \r\n2nd M/Mec Alain Bouydron,\r\nQM/Mec Philippe Janin, \r\nQM/Mec Philippe Orliac,\r\nQM/Mec Louis Tanguy,\r\nQM/Mec Alain Ducasse, \r\nM/Mec Patrick Mira,\r\nM/Mec Fran\u00e7ois Chotard,\r\nM/Mec Didier Le Goff,\r\nM/Mec Jean-Marie Rambaud,\r\nM/Mec Christian Dreau,\r\nM/Mec Claude Lecoustaouec,\r\nM/Mec Jo\u00ebl Jaffres,\r\nM/Mec Guy Le Doussal, \r\nM/Eq Jean-Marc Mule,\r\nMat Ben Ah-Mi,\r\nApp/Mec Alain Montas,\r\nApp/Mec Pascal Le Gall,\r\nApp/Mec Dominique Le Goff,\r\nAPP/Mec Eric Descarcin,\r\nApp/Mec Didier Terrec,\r\nApp/Mec Alain Scouarnec.", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty but the assumption that the autopilot system failed in flight was not ruled out."}
