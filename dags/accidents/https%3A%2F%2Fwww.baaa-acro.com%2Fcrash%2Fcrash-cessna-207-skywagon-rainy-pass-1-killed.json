Lost and disoriented, he flew into a blind canyon when he saw high obstructions. While initiating an evasive maneuver to avoid collision, he made a steep turn to the left when the aircraft struck the ground and crashed in flames in a mountainous terrain located about 125 miles northwest from the city of Anchorage. As the airplane failed to arrive at destination, SAR operations were initiated but eventually abandoned few days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the pilot was found. On September 2, 1980, the burnt wreckage was found near Rainy Pass. ", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain after the pilot became lost and disoriented.
