Evidence at the wreckage site revealed that the airplane crashed through the trees at a glide angle of 8\u00b0. The glide angle for a power-off forced landing is 6\u00b0 according to the pilot's operating handbook. The propeller did not exhibit rotational damage. Engine teardown revealed that the #1 cylinder had catastrophic detonation. All seven occupants were killed, among them two British, two German and two Swiss tourists, and the US pilot. ", "probable_cause": "Detonation (or pre-ignition) in the n\u00b01 cylinder, which resulted in erosion (burning) of the n\u00b01 piston and subsequent loss of engine power. A factor related to the accident was: the lack of suitable terrain for an emergency landing."}
