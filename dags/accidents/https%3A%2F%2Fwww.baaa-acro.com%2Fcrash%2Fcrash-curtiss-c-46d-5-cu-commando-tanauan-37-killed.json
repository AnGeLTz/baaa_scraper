There were on board 30 passengers, most of them wounded people, and a crew of 7. On approach to Tanauan Airport, weather conditions were marginal with low ceiling. The crew contacted the control tower to obtain instructions and requested five ambulances to stand by for patients. This was the last radio contact and the aircraft failed to arrive. SAR operations were conducted but eventually suspended few days later as no trace of the aircraft was found. It is believed that the aircraft probably crashed into the San Pablo Bay off Tanauan. \nCrew (70th Transport Squadron):\nCpl Delbert V. Beery,\n1st Lt Martha F. Black,\n2nd Lt Clark E.
