While the altitude of 3,500 meters was reached, the aircraft was over the target when a group of four skydivers bailed out. Few seconds later, while the second group was preparing to jump, the emergency parachute of a skydiver mistakenly opened while he was bailing out. The skydiver struck the right stabilizer that was torn off. The aircraft went out of control and the pilot was able to send a distress call before bailing out with the rest of the group. The aircraft crash landed in a field near Haun and was damaged beyond repair. All skydivers were found uninjured while the pilot was killed as his parachute failed to open.", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, it was reported that one of the skydiver struck the right stab after he bailed out and control was lost after the stab was torn off. "}
