On approach to Bromma Airport, the crew encountered marginal weather and icing conditions. At an altitude of 1,150 feet and a speed of 137 knots, flaps were deployed at an angle of 40\u00b0 when control was lost. The airplane entered a nose down attitude and crashed at an angle of 110\u00b0 and a speed of 210 knots in a parking lot located in the residential area of K\u00e4lvesta, about 4,5 km short of runway 12 threshold. The aircraft was totally destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and all 22 occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, weather conditions were considered as marginal with icing conditions and a horizontal visibility of 5 km with a cloud base at 700 feet. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control on final approach due to an excessive accumulation of ice on the horizontal stabilizers after the crew lower the flaps from 32\u00b0 to 40\u00b0. When control was lost, both right engines n\u00b03 and 4 were not running at full power for undetermined reasons, which caused the deicing system to produce an insufficient temperature."}
