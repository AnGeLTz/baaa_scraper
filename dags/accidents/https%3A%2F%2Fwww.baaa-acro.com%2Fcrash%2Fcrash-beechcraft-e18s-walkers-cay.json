After touchdown, the pilot realized his mistake and initiated a go-around procedure. He asked the passenger seating on the right seat (a pilot rated passenger) to retract the flaps. Mistakenly, the passenger raised the landing gear instead. The aircraft sank on its belly, causing both propellers to struck the runway surface. The aircraft caught fire and the pilot elected to continue. During initial climb, he eventually ditched the airplane few dozen metres offshore.
