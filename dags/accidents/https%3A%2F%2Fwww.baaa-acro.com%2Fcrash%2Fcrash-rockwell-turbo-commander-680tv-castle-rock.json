On previous flights over the same route, two refueling stops were made. During this trip, no refueling was accomplished, and while en route, the low fuel warning light came on. The pilot declared an emergency and was vectored and assigned the lowest possible IFR altitude. Shortly thereafter, both engines quit. When he enquired about nearby airports, the pilot was told there were none and advised to find a road or suitable area to land. The pilot overshot a road after feathering both engines and crashed on an embankment. There was no smell of fuel at the scene of the crash. Both props were in the feathered position.
