Eleven occupants, among them five crew members, were killed. 26 other occupants were injured and the aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": "The copilot was in command at the time of the accident. While climbing, the aircraft stalled and crashed into the sea due to a false trailing edge flaps position to 35\u00b0. According to investigations, it appears that crew did not complete the preflight briefing and the copilot was not sufficiently familiarized with this type of aircraft. The security system in charge to position the trailing edge flaps in a safety angle for the climbing procedure has been disconnected during a previous flight for unknown reasons. The crew did not realize the trailing edge flaps were deployed at 35\u00b0 and the alarm coupled to this system did not activate because it was on OFF position."}
