Touchdown was hard. A witness said the aircraft landed approximately 1/3 of the way down the 5,200 feet runway. After landing, with the props in 'ground fine,' braking action was ineffective on the wet runway. The aircraft was not equipped with an anti-skid braking system. Subsequently, the aircraft continued off the runway and went down an embankment into a field. Scrub marks on the runway and reverted rubber on the tires indicated the aircraft was hydroplaning. According to the flight manual, 4,500 feet (plus a 10% factor for no anti-skid) would have been required to stop on a dry runway in the prevailing weather conditions, which included a slight tailwind. Two pax, acting as flight attendants (f/a's), assisted the other pax in evacuating. An investigation revealed the f/a's were not properly trained; the pax were not completely briefed before the flight; and the passenger briefing cards were inadequate. The aircraft was on a business flight to transport an entertainment troupe.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: overrun\r\nPhase of operation: landing - roll\r\nFindings\r\n1.
