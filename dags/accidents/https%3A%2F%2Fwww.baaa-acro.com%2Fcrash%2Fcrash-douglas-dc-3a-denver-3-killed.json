Witnesses reported that at between 0720 and 0725 the aircraft was seen to stall, enter a spin, and strike the ground in a diving attitude before recovery was effected.", "probable_cause": "The Board finds that the probable cause of this accident was an inadvertent spin at an altitude too low for recovery. The following findings were pointed out:\r\n- The load was properly distributed within approved center of gravity limits and the aircraft was lightly loaded, carrying only the crew in addition to the fuel, oil and ballast,\r\n- No malfunctioning of the aircraft or its components was reported prior to the accident, and no evidence of malfunctioning or failure was indicated by examination of the wreckage,\r\n- The aircraft stalled at an altitude of approximately 8,200 feet MSL (about 3,200 feet above the ground), entered a spin, and crashed before recovery could be effected,\r\n- Power was being developed by both engines upon impact."}
