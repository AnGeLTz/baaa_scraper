After takeoff the aircraft was observed heading northeast toward the mountains. Aircraft departing Aspen usually fly a northern heading, then turn northeast after clearing the mountains. Witnesses stated that the weather was good in the valley north of the airport, but the mountain tops east of the airport were obscured by low clouds. The aircraft crashed 3 1/2 miles northeast of the airport at the 9,000 feet level of an 11,000 feet mountain. The last time the pilot had flown into Aspen was in 1980. All four occupants were killed.
