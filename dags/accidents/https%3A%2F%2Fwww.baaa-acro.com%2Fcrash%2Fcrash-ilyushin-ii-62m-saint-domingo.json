The crew was cleared for an immediate return and the aircraft landed uneventful few minutes later. All 117 occupants evacuated safely. However, the aircraft was considered as damaged beyond repair due to severe damages to the engines n\u00b02 and n\u00b01 as well as the fuselage because debris of the engine n\u00b02 punctured the fuselage and came to rest in the cabin.
