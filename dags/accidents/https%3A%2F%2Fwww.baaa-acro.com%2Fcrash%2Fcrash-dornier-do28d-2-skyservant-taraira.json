As the crew was unable to receive a last weather bulletin for the destination airport, he decided to divert to Taraira. Following a waiting period on the ground, the crew decided to takeoff but the soft runway surface was wet. Unable to gain sufficient speed, the crew abandoned the takeoff procedure but the aircraft overran and came to rest. All three occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Decision by the crew to abort takeoff from an inappropriate field due to the wet conditions and soft surface which produced higher coefficients of friction and a lower acceleration factor that prevented reaching takeoff speed after which the crew determined to discontinue the takeoff without sufficient stopping distance, which led to the accident."}
