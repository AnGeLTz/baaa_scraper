The aircraft take off weight was 33,426 lbs which was near the maximum allowable takeoff weight of 34,500. The aircraft became airborne after an abnormally long run and circled the area while climbing to 700\u2019. As the direct route to the patrol area, Seaforth Channel, was closed by weather PO Joseph headed south via the west side of Lama Passage. The ceiling lowered so he descended to stay under the cloud. Suddenly the fog closed in and Joseph turned the aircraft to the left attempting to return to Base on a reciprocal course. His airspeed was 120 knots but altitude could not be maintained in the 35 degree turn like he used to do in a Stranraer. The aircraft was leveled off after turning through 120 degrees as they were getting close to the water. The aircraft was put into a steep climbing position at full power. They had started climbing in the patchy fog when the pilot saw a wooded ridge. They increased the rate of climb and the speed dropped to 70 knots and was down to 50 knots by the time they mushed into the 700\u2019 mark on an 800\u2019 ridge. On impact the a/c caught fire. They had been airborne a total of five minutes. \nCrew:\nP/O J. A. Joseph, pilot,\nF/Sgt K. L. Brown, copilot,\nP/O J. L. Jones, navigator,\nF/O R. B.

He then realized the presence of hills ahead and attempted to clear them by climbing but was unable to. It would have been advisable to have landed straight ahead when he encountered the fog or to have climbed to 2,000\u2019 and then proceeded to sea rather than attempting a turn at low altitude in a narrow channel with a heavily laden aircraft."}
