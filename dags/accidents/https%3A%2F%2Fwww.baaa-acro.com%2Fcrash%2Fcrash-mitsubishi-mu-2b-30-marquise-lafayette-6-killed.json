A Jeppesen US (lo) 29 low alt enroute chart was found at the wreckage that had a line drawn traversing southwest out of the Chattanooga VOR between V-115 and V-115e. The MEA for these airways was 4,000 ft msl. Prior to departure the pilot as advised that tops were reported 4,500 ft with another layer at 9,000 ft. The pilot responded he was going to Fort Payne and they had no approach there. Approximately 2-1/2 min after takeoff the pilot reported \"...looks like about 1500 is all we're gonna get right now.\" About 7 min later the pilot reported they were still VFR but might want to turn around.
