Two minutes after takeoff from Goose Bay Airport, while climbing, the crew raised the flaps when the aircraft stalled. Simultaneously, the left wing broke out at its root. Out of control, the airplane dove into the ground and crashed, killing all three occupants. It was reported that ground maintenance was provided on the left port inner trailing edge flap. ", "probable_cause": "A sudden spontaneous full flap retraction caused the nose of the aircraft to drop. Loads on the wing exceeded the design strength, causing the left hand wing to break off. It struck the tail, causing the airplane to crash."}
