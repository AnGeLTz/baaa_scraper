The aircraft had been flown to Bimini from Opa-Locka, FL. About 75 gallons of fuel was drained from the aircraft. Upon the return to Fort Lauderdale, FL, the landing gear had to be manually operated because of a known pre-existing electrical problem. This also precluded radio communications. Upon executing a touch and go landing at Fort Lauderdale the fuel pressure lights which had been flickering now came on steady on the right engine. The pilot cut the mixture on that engine at 500 feet agl. Almost immediately the left engine light came on and it quit also. The aircraft was crash landed. Post accident examination revealed that all fuel tanks were empty. The aircraft owner said the aircraft had 145 gallons on board prior to leaving Florida. The aircraft flew about one hour and 20 minutes at 50 gallons an hour plus offloading 75 gallons at Bimini.\n\n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power(total) - nonmechanical\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
