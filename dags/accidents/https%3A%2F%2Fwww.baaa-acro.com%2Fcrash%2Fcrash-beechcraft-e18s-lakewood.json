After takeoff the gear would not retract electrically and the passenger had to crank up the gear manually. After the parachute jump the pilot shut down the left engine to isolate the vibration. He then started the left engine and feathered the right engine. Unable to unfeather the right engine he elected to land with full flaps and gear down after a straight-in approach. As he approached the threshold a Cessna 150 taxied onto the runway. The pilot executed a go-around while trying to retract the flaps and gear electrically without results. The passenger was attempting to retract the gear manually when the aircraft struck a tree. The pilot stated he did not make his landing intentions known on unicom during the approach. No pre-impact discrepancies were found to preclude normal prop operation. Normal elect power is halved with one generation inoperative.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power(total) - non mechanical\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
