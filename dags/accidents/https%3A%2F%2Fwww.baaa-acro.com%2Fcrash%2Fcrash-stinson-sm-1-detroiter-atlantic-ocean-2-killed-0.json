The aircraft named 'Endeavour' departed RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, at 0845LT bound to the US. The single engine was spotted over Crookhaven, in the Cork county, and later by the crew of the French steamer 'Josiah Macy'. As the aircraft failed to arrive at destination, SAR operations were undertaken for several days but eventually suspended as no trace of the aircraft nor the crew was found. On December 1928, a wheel from the aircraft (with a serial number proving it was from this aircraft) was found on a beach in the Donegal county, Ireland. This was the only trace ever found. According to authorities, it is believed that the aircraft probably crashed into the ocean around 1400LT. ", "probable_cause": null}
