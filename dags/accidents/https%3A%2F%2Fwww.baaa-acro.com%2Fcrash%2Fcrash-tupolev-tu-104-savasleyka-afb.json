Without checking local conditions, the flight director authorized the crew to divert to Dyagilevo. Upon arrival, the pilot was forced to make a go around due to poor weather conditions and it was then decided to divert to the Savasleyka Airbase located 200 km northeast of Dyagilevo. On final approach to Savasleyka Airfield, both engines stopped simultaneously. The airplane stalled, struck trees and crashed in a wooded area located 1,500 meters short of runway. The aircraft was destroyed and all eight crew members were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "Double engine failure caused by a fuel exhaustion. "}
