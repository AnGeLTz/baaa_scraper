When asked if equipment was needed, he replied, 'negative, sir, a little matter of fuel.' A witness said the aircraft appeared very low on final approach with both props turning. The aircraft crash landed short of the runway, went thru a perimeter fence and came to rest on an incline about 10 feet short of the runway. The pilot received a head injury and couldn't remember many details of the occurrence. In an early interview, he induced there was a partial power loss and the aircraft yawed, but he couldn't remember which engine 'cut out first.' Later, he was unable to recall losing power. Six gallons of fuel was found in the left main tank, about 1.5 gallon was in the right main tank. The left fuel selector was found in the 'main' position, but due to damage and rescue activities, the position of the right fuel selector was not determined. Both auxiliary pump switches were in the 'off' position. The left propeller control was in the feather position, but neither propeller had feathered. Each main tank held one gallon of unusable fuel. A test of the pilot's blood showed 0,45\u2030 alcohol.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (partial) - nonmechanical\r\nPhase of operation: approach\r\nFindings\r\n1.
