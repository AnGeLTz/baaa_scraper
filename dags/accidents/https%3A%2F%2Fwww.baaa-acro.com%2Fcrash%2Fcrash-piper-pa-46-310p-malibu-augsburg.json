En route, the pilot encountered technical problems with the engine, informed ATC about his situation and activated the electrical fuel pump when the engine restarted. On final approach to Ausgburg, he re-encountered engine problems and attempted an emergency landing when the airplane hit power cables and crashed in a garden located 1,123 meters short of runway 07 threshold. The pilot was seriously injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The aircraft accident is due to the fact that, due to incorrect operation of the auxiliary fuel pump, the engine no longer assumed power on the approach and ran out. Due to the low altitude, the pilot initiated an emergency landing. The landing failed because the aircraft collided with an obstacle and fell uncontrollably to the ground."}
