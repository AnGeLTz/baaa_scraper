It was departing Gander for RAF Valley, Wales. According to the crash report, the aircraft climbed steeply \u2013 so steeply that one witness, F/O Fisher, remarked that the climb was similar to that of a single engine bomber rather than a B-17 \u2013 to about 500 to 600 feet then banked to the left to turn to the south. At approximately 15 degrees into the turn, the nose of the aircraft dropped suddenly. Cpl. George W. Stiffler witnessed the crash from the Gander Control Tower, and stated that the engines did not appear to be having trouble, with the exception that three engines were exhausting blue flame and the #1 engine was exhausting yellow flame. The aircraft was still in a turn when it crashed. Witnesses and investigators agree that the left wing touched first, the aircraft caught fire immediately, skidded several hundred feet, and then exploded with flames shooting 500 to 600 feet into the air. All ten crew members were killed. \nCrew:\n1st Lt Bruce E. Ryan, pilot,\n2nd Lt Stephen A. Wooten, pilot, \n2nd Lt John J. Gentile, navigator,\nSgt Charles Thayer, flight engineer, \nCpl Frederick A.
