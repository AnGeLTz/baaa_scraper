Due to low clouds, the crew was forced to fly at low height from Florence to Pisa and apparently, the weather conditions dropped as the aircraft approached Pisa Airport. Descending from the south in poor visibility, the aircraft hit the slope of a mountain and crashed near the village of Collesalvetti, south of the airport. All three crew members and four passengers were killed while three other passengers were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "It is believed the accident was caused by successive errors on part of the crew, causing the aircraft to be too low and off track at the time of the accident. Low visibility caused by poor weather conditions should be considered as a contributory factor. "}
