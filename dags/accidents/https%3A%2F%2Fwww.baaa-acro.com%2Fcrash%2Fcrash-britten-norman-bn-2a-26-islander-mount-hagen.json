After takeoff, while climbing to a height of about 100 feet, the engine lost power. At a speed of 50 knots, the pilot attempted an emergency landing when the aircraft struck the ground, rolled for about 80 metres and collided with rocks. All three occupants were slightly injured and the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "No definite conclusion can be reached as to why the aircraft performed so poorly, but from a hypothetical point of view a combination of some of the following could lead to the events that occurred:\r\n1. Substantial inadvertent overload.\r\n2. Mixture excessively rich.\r\n3. Carburettor heat inadvertently selected to hot for takeoff.\r\n4. Aircraft encountered an area of subtle downdraft/downflowing airstream.\r\n5. Propeller controls not set for maximum RPM."}
