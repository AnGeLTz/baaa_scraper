The pilot then remained clear of the clouds and executed a no-flap circling approach to the opposite direction runway. The pilot said that his airspeed was high when he touched down.

No preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures were found that would have precluded normal operation.\n", "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s continuation of the approach with excessive airspeed, which resulted in a hard landing and a loss of directional control."}
