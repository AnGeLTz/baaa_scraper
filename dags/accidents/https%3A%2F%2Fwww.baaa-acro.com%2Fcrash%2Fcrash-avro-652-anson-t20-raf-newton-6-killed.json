On final approach, the pilot encountered poor weather conditions and sighted the runway after passing the last cloud layer at a height of 200 feet. Due to few patches of fog, he lost the runway and decided to make a go around. The aircraft slightly climbed then stalled and crashed in a huge explosion. Six crew members were killed while a seventh was seriously injured. It was reported that the total weight of the aircraft was above the max landing weight, which was considered as a contributory factor. ", "probable_cause": null}
