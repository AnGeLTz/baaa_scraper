Byron, \u2020 +11.", "probable_cause": "On the basis of the foregoing findings and the entire record available, the commission find that the probable cause of the accident was the failure of the captain in charge of the flight to exercise the proper degree of dare by not checking his altimeters to determine whether both were correctly set and properly functioning before commencing his landing approach. A substantial contributing factor was the absence of an established uniform cockpit procedure on Eastern Air Lines by which both the captain and pilot are required to make a complete check of the controls and instruments during landing operations ."}
