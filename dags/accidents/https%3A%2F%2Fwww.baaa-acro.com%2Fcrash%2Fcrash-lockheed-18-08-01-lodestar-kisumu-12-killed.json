The captain decided to return to Kisumu but the twin engine aircraft crashed into the gulf of Kavirondo, 13 km off Kisumu. All 12 occupants were killed.\nCrew (61st Squadron):\nCpt J. D. Mail, \nLt W. B. Lloyd, \nSgt C. V. Flusk, \nCpl LaFayette.\nPassengers: \nMaj Gen D. H. Pienaar , \nCol F. Theron, \nLt/Col E. V. Frykberg, \nLt/Col E. L. Mackenzie, \nMaj J. W. A. Bell, \nMaj F. Rawlins, \nCpt P. Bairnsfather-Cloete, \nSgt A. F. Weldon.\nSource: ASN", "probable_cause": "The combined difficulties of endeavouring to raise the undercarriage and maintain height and speed with a fully loaded aircraft during a night take-off under unfavourable flying conditions gave rise to an error of judgement in which the pilot allowed the aircraft to fly into the water. A contributory cause was the fatigue of the 'elderly pilot' who had flown 1800 miles in the previous 24 hours and had only 6 hours sleep and was trying to reach South Africa at the special request of General Pienaar as soon as possible. No evidence of sabotage was found."}
