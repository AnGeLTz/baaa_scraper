In the evening, a team of six technicians was dispatched to convoy the aircraft to the main terminal where 319 passengers should embark on a flight to Jeddah. While on a taxiway, the engineers attempted to turn to another taxiway when control was lost. The aircraft veered off taxiway and came to rest, nose first, in a drainage ditch. All six occupants were injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. At the time of the accident, only the engine n\u00b02 and 3 only were running and it is believed that the auxiliary hydraulic pump switches were in the OFF position. Thus, the nosewheel steering system was inoperative as well as the brakes. ", "probable_cause": null}
