Debris were found few hours later some 28 km south of Jersey Island. All 10 occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nCpt William Halmshaw, pilot, \r\nW. Sotinel, mechanic. \r\nPassengers: \r\nErnest Appleby,\r\nMaud Bean,\r\nMargaret Davies,\r\nAlice Judd,\r\nEdwina 'Elsie' Marley,\r\nFlorence Annie Simpson,\r\nCharles Viel,\r\nClaude Stewart Willis.", "probable_cause": "It was theorized that the flight in turbulent conditions may have caused a small quantity of fuel in the bottom of the tank to surge sufficiently to uncover the tank outlet temporarily, and thus cause one or both fuel pumps to become air-locked. The aircraft\u2019s undercarriage had been extended at the time of the ditching, suggesting that the pilot had tried to reach land after the failure of one or both power plants. Rescue efforts had been hampered by the heavy seas and the fact that G-ABXW was not equipped with radio equipment, which could have been used to establish its position. It was in fact noted in the report of the UK Accidents Investigation Branch that the dispatch of an aircraft without a radio violated established directives."}
