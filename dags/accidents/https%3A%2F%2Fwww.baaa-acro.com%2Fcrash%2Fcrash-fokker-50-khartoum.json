A technical problem occurred with the left main gear that remained stuck in its wheel well and failed to deploy. The crew decided to return to Khartoum. On approach to Khartoum-Haj Yusuf Airport runway 18, the crew elected to lower the gear manually but without success. The aircraft landed with both nose and right main gear deployed. After touchdown, the left wing contacted the runway surface. The aircraft slid for about 1,350 metres then veered to the left and came to rest. All 45 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was later considered as damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
