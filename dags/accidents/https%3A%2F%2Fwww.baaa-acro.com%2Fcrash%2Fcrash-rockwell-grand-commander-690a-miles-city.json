The pilot said he turned on the autopilot and after turning inbound from the procedure turn towards the faf he engaged the approach mode. After crossing the faf the pilot descended to MDA and engaged the altitude hold mode. When he reached the map the pilot started to make a missed approach but a passenger, seated next to him in the copilot's seat, reported the runway in sight. The pilot said he saw the runway and retarded the throttles in order to descend for landing. The aircraft nose pitched up abruptly, the aircraft stalled, and mushed to the ground. The aircraft hit hard and skidded off the runway. Two occupants were injured and four others escaped uninjured.
