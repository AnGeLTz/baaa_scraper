While climbing to an altitude of 7,000 feet, the engine n\u00b03 exploded and caught fire. The crew declared an emergency and was cleared to return for a landing on runway 25L. After the fire was contained and while completing a last turn on final, the airplane was approaching too fast and overshot so the pilot decided to land on runway 25R. After touchdown, reversers on engine n\u00b01 and 4 were activated and the crew initiated an emergency braking procedure. Nevertheless, the captain considered the remaining distance as insufficient and decided to steer the aircraft to the left of the runway where it came to rest. All 117 occupants were quickly rescued and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the explosion of the engine n\u00b03 was the consequence of the disintegration of a blade located on the 10th stage of the compressor due to fatigue cracks. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Approach completed with one engine inoperative, \r\n- The total weight of the aircraft was above the max allowable weight upon landing, \r\n- The approach speed was too high,\r\n- The crew failed to use the brakes properly.
