The controller transmitted an advisory, but got no reply. He made several more radio calls and received 2 replies. Later, a review of the radio transcript indicated the pilot's 1st reply was something about 'ice.' In his 2nd response to an inquiry from the controller about 'how do you hear me,' he replied 'good.' After that there was no further contact with the flight. Wreckage from the aircraft was found scattered over a 6 miles area, indicating an in-flight breakup. Pieces from the horizontal stabilizers were found from 2 to 6 miles from the main wreckage. The right wing was found 2 miles from the main wreckage and the left outboard wing panel was found about 1 mile from the right wing. During a preflight briefing, the pilot was advised of turbulences and icing conditions; he was told to expect light to moderate rime icing in clouds thru 15,000 feet, but the aircraft was equipped for flight in icing conditions. A check of the pilot's liver fluid showed a benzoylecgonine (cocaine metabolite) level of 0.136 mg/l. Both occupants were killed.
