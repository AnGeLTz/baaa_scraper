When the aircraft was about to leave the paved surface, the commander prematurely attempted liftoff. The aircraft momentarily became airborne and unable to sustain flight due to low flying speed impacted the kutcha side strip on the left side of the runway. The aircraft got destroyed due to impact force and post impact fire. During the process of evacuation 19 passengers and four crew members received minor injuries. ", "probable_cause": "The cause of the accident has been attributed to commander attempting takeoff after experiencing uncommanded and uncontrollable yaw to the left during takeoff roll and executed premature liftoff to avoid aircraft rolling onto kutcha surface resulting in the aircraft to crash onto the ground. Loss of directional control was probably due to deflection of left wheel which was a contributory factor to the accident."}
