After crossing the border between both Koreas, the airplane was escorted by three fighters and the crew was forced to land at Sondok Airport near Wonsan. Apparently, the landing was 'missed' and the airplane was severely damaged upon arrival. Nevertheless, none of the 52 occupants were injured but arrested and interned by the North Korean Authorities. Following negotiations with South Korea, 39 passengers were released and sent back to South Korea on 14 February 1970. But all four crew members and nine passengers plus the hijacker were not released.
