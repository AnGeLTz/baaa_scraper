While descending to Concepci\u00f3n-Carriel Sur Airport in poor weather conditions, the twin engine aircraft hit tree tops and crashed in a wooded area located some 20 km north of the airport, near Tom\u00e9. All six occupants were killed. They should inspect installations in Concepci\u00f3n following the earthquake from 27FEB2010. \r\nPilot: \r\nMarcelo Ruiz.\r\nPassengers:\r\nErnesto Videla,\r\nPablo Desbordes,\r\nIgnacio Fern\u00e1ndez,\r\nRodolfo Becker,\r\nGuillermo Moya.", "probable_cause": "The pilot continued the approach in low visibility and let the aircraft descending below the minimum safe altitude. At the time of impact, the aircraft was 10\u00b0 off track (017\u00b0 radial) for a runway 20 approach in IMC. Consequently, investigators feel that the accident was caused by a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT). Poor efficiency in procedures execution on part of the pilot by executing an approach in IMC with a twin engine aircraft was considered as a contributory factor, and his relative low experience on type.
