They couldn't make the field and the pilots and the engineer put the plane down intact on the beach. The slanted beach caused them to veer into the surf and the aircraft ended up in about 10 feet of water. The crew was able to exit the astrodome hatch and swim to shore.  Overnight the action of the tide destroyed the aircraft. The rumors that the aircraft was repaired, flown off the beach and put back in service are untrue.\r\nSource: http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_serials/1953.html", "probable_cause": null}
