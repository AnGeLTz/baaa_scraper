A stop was scheduled in Carcassonne to deliver 50 kg of cargo. As the runway at Carcassonne Airport was wet, the crew decided to fly to Toulouse-Francazal Airport where he landed at 1015LT. The airplane took off at 1450LT for the second leg to Perpignan-La Llaban\u00e8re. En route, the crew encountered poor weather conditions and informed ground about his position over Pamiers at 1545LT then radio contact was lost. As the airplane failed to arrive in Perpignan, SAR operations were initiated but eventually suspended few weeks later as no trace of the airplane nor the crew was found. On 2 December 1949, a park ranger found the wreckage on the north face of Pic d'Estable, near Puilaurens. The aircraft was destroyed and all four occupants were killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nS/Lt Marcel Henri Wingert, pilot, \r\nAdj/C Ren\u00e9 Hilaire Kleber Margouet, \r\nAdj Jean Jules D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Pater. \r\nPassenger:\r\nCpt Ren\u00e9 Pierre Parpiel.", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the accident was the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain after the crew encountered limited visibility due to poor weather conditions between Toulouse and Perpignan.
