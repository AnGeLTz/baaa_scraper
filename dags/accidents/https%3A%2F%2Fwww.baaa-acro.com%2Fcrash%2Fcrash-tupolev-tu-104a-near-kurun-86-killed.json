Once this altitude was reached, ATC cleared the crew to continue to climb to 8,000 meters. While climbing to the altitude of 4,500 meters, the copilot was able to send a brief distress call, reporting severe vibrations and that control was lost. The airplane entered a dive and eventually crashed in a 50-60\u00b0 nose-down attitude in a huge explosion some 15 km southwest of the village of Kurun, some 96 km northeast of Khabarovsk. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 86 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft struck the ground in a 50-60\u00b0 nose-down attitude, at high speed and on a slight left bank. Investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the accident and the civil investigators were not authorized to access some documents that were classified. It is possible that a technical problem occurred with the autopilot or ailerons or elevators. The assumption that the aircraft may have been shot down by a surface-to-air missile shot by Soviet forces conducting an exercise from the Litovko Training Center was not ruled out. "}
