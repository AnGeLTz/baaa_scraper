The crew initiated a go-around manoeuvre when 22 seconds later, the power was reset. The crew contacted ATC to obtain a landing clearance but as a Pan Am Boeing 707 was taking off from the same runway, ATC instructed the crew to extend a downwind circuit to the west. Few minutes later, while cruising under VFR mode at an altitude of 800 feet, the airplane went out of control and crashed into the Marmara Sea about 30 km west of the Airport. The aircraft was destroyed and all 42 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined. However, it is believed that the pilot-in-command may lose control of the airplane after suffering a spatial disorientation while flying by night under VFR mode over the Marmara Sea without any visual reference points.
