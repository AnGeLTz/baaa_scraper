N5113S was used as the camera platform. The pilots of N5113S and N4346L discussed prior to takeoff the procedures of the flight. Both aircraft departed and flew a course to position the airplanes on a southerly heading. N5113S was to the east and slightly above and ahead of N4346L. The photographer shot one roll of film and reloaded. He was ready to begin shooting when N4346L began to close in on N5113S. The pilot of N5113S felt two 'bumps' as N4346L closed, and did not see the aircraft pass under. The pilot of N5113S maneuvered his aircraft to determine controllability and saw N4346L spiralling to the ground. Examination of N4346L revealed the vertical stab and rudder had separated in-flight. There were numerous paint smears found on the right side on N5113S. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
