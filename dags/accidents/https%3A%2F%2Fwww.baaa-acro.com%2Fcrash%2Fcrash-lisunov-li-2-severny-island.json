The airplane bounced, climbed to a height of 1,5-2 meters then stalled and crashed 300 meters farther. All six crew members were uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "Wrong takeoff configuration on part of the crew who attempted to takeoff at an insufficient speed. The captain should abandon the takeoff procedure instead to continue in such conditions. The following factors were considered as contributing:\n- The braking performance was reduced due to the high salting of the ground, \n- The 'runway' surface was uneven."}
