On final approach, the instructor voluntarily shut down one engine. During the last segment, the aircraft banked left and right and the control became difficult. In such conditions, the instructor decided to raise the undercarriage, increased power on the three remaining engines and started a go around. The aircraft stalled and hit the runway surface, slid on its belly for several yards and came to rest. All three crew members were unhurt while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": null}
