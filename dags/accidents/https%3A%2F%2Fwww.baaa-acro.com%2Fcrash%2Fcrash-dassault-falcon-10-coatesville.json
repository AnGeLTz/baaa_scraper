The flight crew noted there was no output from the #2 gen and it would not reset. They then checked the #1 gen voltage and noted it was 14 to 15 volts. The crew reduced the electrical load; however, about 5 minutes later, the batteries became discharged and there was a total loss of electrical power. Using a flashlight, the crew diverted to the Chester County Airport which had a 4,600 feet runway. The gear was extended with the emergency system. The elevator trim was inoperative, so both pilots applied back pressure on the yoke to overcome the nose down tendency. After landing about 1/4 of the way down the runway, the crew tried to use the thrust reversers, but the reversers were inoperative. Subsequently, the aircraft continued off the side and beyond the end of the runway, hit a wooden beam and a snowbank, then came to rest in a ditch. An investigation revealed a shaft failure of the #2 gen (starter/gen) and worn brushes in the #1 gen. With total electrical failure, the following were also inoperative: wing flaps, anti-skid, capt's airspeed indicator and altimeter, nose wheel steering, cockpit lighting.
