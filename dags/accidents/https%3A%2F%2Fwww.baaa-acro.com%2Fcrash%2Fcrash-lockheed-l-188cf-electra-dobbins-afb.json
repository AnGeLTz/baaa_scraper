Attempts to recycle the gear were unsuccessful. The flight crew diverted to Atlanta, GA; then decided to land at Dobbins AFB, where there was a long, wide runway that could be foamed. Foam was applied to approximately 300 feet of runway 29. The aircraft was landed with the nose and left main gear extended and the right main gear partially retracted. Subsequently, the aircraft veered to the right and stopped with the nose gear approximately 70 feet off the runway. Fire erupted in the area of the right main gear; however, the fire was quickly extinguished by fire dept personnel. An investigation revealed the clearance between the main landing gear door hook, pn 803845-1, and the strut roller was excessive. The reason for the improper clearance was not determined. Lockheed service bulletin 88/sb-558 warned that excessive clearance combined with a drop in hydraulic pressure, gust or maneuver could result in the gear jamming. All three crew members were uninjured. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: airframe/component/system failure/malfunction\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
