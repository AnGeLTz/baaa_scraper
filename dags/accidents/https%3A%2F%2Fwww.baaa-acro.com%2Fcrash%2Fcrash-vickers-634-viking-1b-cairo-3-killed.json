On final approach to runway 32, the crew voluntarily shot down the left engine and feathered its propeller to conduct an asymmetric landing. It is believed the aircraft was unstable as it landed too long, in the last third of the runway. In such conditions, the captain decided to make a go around and increased power on the right engine when the aircraft stalled and crashed in flames. Three crew members were killed while a fourth occupant was seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": null}
