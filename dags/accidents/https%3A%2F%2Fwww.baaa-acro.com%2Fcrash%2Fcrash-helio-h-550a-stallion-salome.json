The surface wind conditions were reported to be from the south at or above 20 knots. The pilot reported that he approached the mountain peak in a southerly direction and climbed the airplane to an altitude of 150 feet above the ground to clear the mountain. The airplane encountered downdraft conditions on the lee side of the mountain. The pilot failed to immediately correct for this condition and the airplane collided with the upsloping mountainous terrain when the pilot was executing a 180\u00b0 turn.    ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's inadequate in-flight planning, improper altitude, and delaying the required remedial action to prevent the collision with the mountain.
