While descending at an altitude of 2,030 feet, the aircraft hit tree tops and crashed in a dense wooded area located on the east slope of Mt Mistberget, about 10 km north of the Gardermoen Airport. The aircraft was destroyed, three crew members were killed (both pilots and the flight engineer) while all other occupants were injured, some of them seriously. ", "probable_cause": "The descent was started prematurely, causing the aircraft to fly under the minimum safe altitude when it hit the slope of the mountain. It is considered that the accident was the result of a controlled flight into terrain, and that the crew inexperience and some radio range equipment deficiencies were considered as contributory factors.
