There were two persons on board the aircraft including the commander. After two circuits and landings, the commander asked for full stop landing. However, after landing the commander asked the ATC about one more circuit to which the controller gave the consent and asked him to line up on runway 28 for take off. At this stage, the copilot on board was disembarked. The aircraft took-off without ATC clearance and turned left for circuit. Thereafter, it was seen going down in a nose down attitude and impacted the ground. The aircraft impacted the ground, caught fire and was destroyed. The pilot, who was the sole occupant on board, received fatal injuries. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could be confirmed.
