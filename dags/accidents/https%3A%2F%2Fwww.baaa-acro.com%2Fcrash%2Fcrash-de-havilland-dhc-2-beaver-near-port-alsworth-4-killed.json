When the airplane did not arrive at the lake, a search was initiated, and two days later the wreckage of the airplane was located on the side of a box canyon about the 2,400 foot elevation level. The canyon is oriented approximately east-west, and the wreckage was distributed along a 100 foot debris field on the north flank of the canyon. Ground scars and wreckage distribution were consistent with the airplane impacting terrain in a steep left bank while executing a turn to reverse direction. No evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomalies was discovered.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to maintain clearance from terrain while maneuvering inside a box/blind canyon, resulting in an in-flight collision with terrain. A factor contributing to the accident was the box/blind canyon."}
