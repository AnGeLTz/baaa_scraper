During initial climb, the captain turn slightly to the right and continued at low height when the aircraft contacted tree tops, stalled and crashed in a wooded area located in Regensberg, about 8 km northwest of the airport. Debris scattered on more than 200 meters and all four crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the instructor decided to make a turn to the right after rotation rather than to follow the published procedures asking the crew to make a turn to the left. The reason of this decision could not be determined. Due to an insufficient height, the airplane struck tree tops, stalled and crashed in a dense wooded area. The lack of visibility caused by foggy conditions was considered as a contributing factor. "}
