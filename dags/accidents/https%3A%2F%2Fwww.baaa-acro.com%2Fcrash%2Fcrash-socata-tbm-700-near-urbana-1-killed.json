The pilot sustained fatal injuries. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Preliminary air traffic control information revealed the airplane was en route from the Erie Ottawa Airport (PCW), Port Clinton, Ohio, to the Cincinnati Municipal Airport (LUK), Cincinnati, Ohio. The airplane departed runway 9 at PCW and climbed to flight level 200 before beginning to descend. The airplane was southbound, descending to 12,000 ft mean sea level (msl), and established communications with the assigned terminal radar approach control controller. The controller cleared the pilot to descent to 10,000 ft msl and proceed direct to LUK. While descending through 12,100 ft msl, the airplane entered a left turn. The controller observed the left turn and asked the pilot if everything was alright; there was no response from the pilot. Radar contact was subsequently lost with the airplane. The controller\u2019s further attempts to establish communications were unsuccessful. A witness, located about 2 miles south of the accident location, stated that he observed the airplane at a high altitude in a nose-dive descent toward the terrain. He reported the airplane was not turning or spinning; it was headed straight down. The witness observed no signs of distress, such as smoke, fire, or parts coming off the airplane, and he stated the airplane\u2019s engine was at full throttle. The witness lost sight of the airplane as it descended behind some trees. The accident site was located 1.3 miles northwest of the last radar contact. The accident site showed the airplane impacted trees, two powerlines, and the terrain in a left-wing low attitude. The initial ground scar, located in a residential yard, contained separated components of the left wing. The airplane crossed a highway, struck trees and a ditch, and then continued into mature potato and soybean fields. The airplane wreckage was scattered at a distance of about 2,050 ft along a measured magnetic heading of 275\u00b0. According to acquaintances of the pilot, the pilot purchased the airplane about 9 days before the accident. Following the purchase, the pilot and a flight instructor completed several hours of ground school and 15.5 hours of dual instruction in the airplane. ", "probable_cause": null}
