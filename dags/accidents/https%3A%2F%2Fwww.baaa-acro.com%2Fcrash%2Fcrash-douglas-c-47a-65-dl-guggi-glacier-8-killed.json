At 1455LT, while cruising at an altitude of 9,000 feet, the radio operator informed ground about his position three km south of Dijon. Apparently due to navigation errors, the airplane then continued to the east over the Swiss Alps when it hit the slope of a mountain surrounding the Guggi Glacier. As the aircraft failed to arrive at destination, Swiss authorities were contacted at the end of the day by the USAF quarters in Frankfurt-Main AB that an airplane was missing. SAR operations were conducted by locals and the wreckage was found a day later at an altitude of 3,000 meters. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and all eight occupants have been killed. \r\nCrew:\r\nLt Col Gus John Mehess, pilot,\r\nLt Col Robert L. Spear, copilot,\r\nMaj Samuel D.
