Approaching Podolsk, weather conditions deteriorated and the captain decided to return to Moscow. But on approach, weather conditions were also poor in Moscow and the visibility was very limited due to fog. On approach, at a height of about 110-120 metres, the airplane collided with an antenna, causing the right wing to be partially torn off. Out of control, the aircraft descended and crashed 65 metres further. Both crew members were killed.
