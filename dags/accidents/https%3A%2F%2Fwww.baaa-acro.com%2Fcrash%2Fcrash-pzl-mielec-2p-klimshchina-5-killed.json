When they arrived in Klimshchina, both pilots were informed that the mission was cancelled so they passed the afternoon at the airport with local farmers and consumed alcohol. At the end of the afternoon, both pilots and three farmers decided to make a local flight and took off from Klimshchina. Ten minutes after takeoff, while flying at a height of eight meters, the captain initiated a right turn when the airplane struck the concrete support of a power transmission line and crashed in flames. A passenger was seriously injured while four other occupants were killed. Three days later, the only survivor died from his injuries.
