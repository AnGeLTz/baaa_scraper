In the mean time, undercarriage was retracted. The speed decreased, the aircraft banked left and eventually crashed in a field located half a mile from the airport. Five passengers were killed while nine other occupants were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The reason of the loss of power on the right engine was not properly determined. However, this occurred at a critical stage of the flight, just after rotation. As the crew was unable to feather the propeller, this increased drag, reduced speed and caused the aircraft to stall. "}
