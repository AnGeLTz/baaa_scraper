While descending to Olyokminsk, the crew encountered poor weather conditions and followed visually the wrong river Sinyaya instead of Lena. Doing so, the aircraft descended prematurely and its altitude was insufficient while passing the outer marker. The aircraft struck trees and crashed on the slope of a wooded hill (434 m high) located 25 km short of runway threshold. The wreckage was found a day later and all four crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Unable to determiner his exact position based on the ETA, the crew erroneously followed the Lena River. As a result of a premature descent, the aircraft collided with trees. ATC, unable to assist the flight by radar in marginal weather conditions, unreasonably gave permission to the crew to perform a straight-in approach, based only on the report of the crew."}
