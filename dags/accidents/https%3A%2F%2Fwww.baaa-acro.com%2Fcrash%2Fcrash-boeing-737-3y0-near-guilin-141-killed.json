Three minutes later, the aircraft went out of control and crashed on a mountain slope (1'600 metres high) located 27 km south from runway 36. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 141 occupants were killed. It was reported that the captain attempted to level off the plane by raising its nose. The autothrottle responded by advancing the throttles. The n\u00b02 power lever however remained at idle. The crew apparently did not notice this. With the right engine at idle, the autothrottle further advanced the left engine power lever in order to obtain the correct airspeed. The asymmetrical power condition was not corrected and the airplane rolled to the right and crashed.", "probable_cause": null}
