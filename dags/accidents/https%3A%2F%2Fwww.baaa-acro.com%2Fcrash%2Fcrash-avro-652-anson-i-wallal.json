At about 0950LT, the aircraft landed at Wallal with crosswinds gusty up to 7 mph. The pilot applied brakes but they did not work due to the nipple pulling off the brake cable. There was not enough runway left to takeoff again so the pilot applied coarse rudder and engine power settings to attempt to turn the aircraft around. This did not work and the aircraft ran off the runway and hit a mound of dirt and then crashed through a fence which knocked the undercarriage off. The aircraft slid for another 20 yards on the fuselage causing extensive damage.\nCrew (7th CU)\nP/O B. R. Wilson  2.\nSource: http://www.ozatwar.com/ozcrashes/wa89.htm", "probable_cause": null}
