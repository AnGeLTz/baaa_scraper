Rather than initiating a go-around procedure, the pilot-in-command continued and the aircraft landed 710 meters past the runway threshold. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran at a speed of 225 km/h, lost its undercarriage then slid for about 317 meters and eventually collided with concrete blocks (2 meters high), bursting into flames. 29 passengers were injured while 34 other occupants were killed, among them all four crew members. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the flying crew (too high on the glide and excessive speed) who failed to initiate a go-around while the landing procedure was obviously missed. The concrete blocks struck by the airplane were part of construction work for the new runway. The following contributing factors were reported: \r\n- The crew violated/neglected various procedures, \r\n- Lack of crew discipline, \r\n- Poor crew coordination, \r\n- The crew failed to use all available braking systems."}
