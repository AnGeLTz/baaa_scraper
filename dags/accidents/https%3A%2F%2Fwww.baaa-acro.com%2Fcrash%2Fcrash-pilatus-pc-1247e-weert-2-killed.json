After liftoff, pilot was instructed to make a left turn and was cleared to climb to 2,000 feet. While flying in clouds, the autopilot was disengaged. The aircraft rolled to the right then entered a steep descent and crashed in an open field located in Weert, east of the airport. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and both occupants were killed, among them Paul Evers, Director of Alko International. ", "probable_cause": "Technical or medical problems could not be ruled out according to Dutch Safety Board. However, it was considered likely that the pilot suffered from spatial disorientation. \r\nFactors were: \r\n- the fact that the autopilot disengaged; \r\n- the high work load following loss of autopilot, during a single-pilot flight; \r\n- the lack of training and experience on advanced aircraft like the PC-12 in manually flying the aircraft in IMC in a non-normal situation."}
