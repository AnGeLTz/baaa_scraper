All five occupants were killed. They were returning to Kansas City following a fishing trip. There was an explosion aboard according to those who saw the accident. The plane did not catch fire, however. Persons who viewed the accident expressed the opinion that lightning struck the plane while flying high, as the aircraft seems to lose a wing before diving into the ground.\r\nCrew:\r\nGene Gabbert.\r\nPassengers:\r\nMurat Boyle, \r\nRaymond Watson, \r\nEugene Lynn, \r\nRoy Dellano.", "probable_cause": null}
