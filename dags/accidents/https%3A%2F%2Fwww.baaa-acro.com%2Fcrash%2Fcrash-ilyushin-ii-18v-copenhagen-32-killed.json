The crew was cleared to descend to 5,000 feet then 1,500 feet when he was trying to intercept the ILS of runway 22L. On final, the four engine aircraft nosed down and plunged into the \u00d8resund few hundred yards off the Saltholm Island. Rescuers were able to evacuate 3 passengers while 31 other occupants were killed. Three days later, one of the survivor died from his injuries. ", "probable_cause": "The probable cause of this accident was loss of control of the aircraft at the moment where the aircraft was about to intercept the ILS glideslope to runway 22L at Copenhagen airport, Kastrup.\r\nAlthough it has not been possible to establish the cause of the loss of control, it is most likely to believe that the aircraft in the landing configuration was affected by a deterioration of the airflow over the tailplane to such a degree that longitudinal stability was lost."}
