For unknown reasons, the captain decided to land on runway 24. The approach was too long and the aircraft landed too far down the runway, about 950 metres past the runway threshold. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, it overran and came to rest in a grassy area against the perimeter fence. All 59 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": null}
