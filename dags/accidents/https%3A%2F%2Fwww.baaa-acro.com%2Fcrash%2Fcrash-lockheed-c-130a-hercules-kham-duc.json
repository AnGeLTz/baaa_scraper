After touch down, the aircraft was uncontrollable and veered off runway before hitting a parked helicopter. All five crewmen were unhurt but the aircraft was later intentionally destroyed. Crew, from the 21st squadron, was flying to Kh\u00e2m \u0110\u1ee9c to evacuate troops on an emergency evacuation process of the camp. \r\nCrew:\r\nCaptain Delmore, pilot,\r\nJoe Donahue, copilot.\r\nThanks to Bill Schneider from the Kh\u00e2m \u0110\u1ee9c Group, who added the following comment: the aircraft was guided off the runway on purpose by superior flying skills. It did not catch on fire at that time but was destroyed for good by USAF fighters that destroyed all remaining assets on the ground, including the SF Camp, engineer equipment and anything that could be of any value to the North Vietnam Army. Delmore's crew was picked up just a few minutes later by a USMC CH-46 helicopter.\n", "probable_cause": "Hydraulic failure on approach caused by artillery bullets. "}
