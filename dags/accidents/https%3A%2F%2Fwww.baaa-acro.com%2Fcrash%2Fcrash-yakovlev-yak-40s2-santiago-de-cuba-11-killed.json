As the crew was unable to locate the airport, he decided to abandon the approach and initiated a go-around. Few minutes later, a second attempt to land was also abandoned. During the third approach completed under VFR mode, the crew failed to realize he was not properly aligned when the aircraft struck at a speed of 280 km/h the top of a hill and crashed 4 km short of runway 27. Two crew members and 9 passengers were killed while 20 other occupants were rescued, among them 12 were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew decided to complete the third approach under VFR mode in adverse weather conditions (IMC). This caused the aircraft to deviate from the approach path and to descent below the minimum prescribed altitude. The wreckage was found one km to the right of the extended centerline. "}
