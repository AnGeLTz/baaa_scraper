En route, while cruising at an altitude of 16,000 feet, the right engine failed. The crew was able to restart it but it failed again few minutes later. The crew started the approach on one engine and landed uneventfully. While decelerating, the nose gear collapsed and the aircraft came to rest. All three crew members escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. Both engines accumulated about 20 hours since the last overhaul and it is believed that the nose gear failed due to fatigue cracks. ", "probable_cause": null}
