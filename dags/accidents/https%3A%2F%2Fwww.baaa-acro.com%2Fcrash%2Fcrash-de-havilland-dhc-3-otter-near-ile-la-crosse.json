Six miles north of Ile-\u00e0-la-Crosse, following an engine failure, the pilot made a forced landed in the bush and the aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair. The flight had proceeded for one hour forty minutes without incident when there was a loud bang from the engine, followed by a complete power loss.  Smoke was emitted into the cockpit and the pilot commenced a forced landing. Attempts to regain power were to no avail and the pilot transmitted a mayday, which was acknowledged by another aircraft. The Otter touched down in a semi-clear area in bush country in a nose high, full flap configuration. The pilot and passenger evacuated the Otter fearing a post crash fire, however none followed. They were located by a rescue party a short time after the crash.\r\nSource: http://www.dhc-3archive.com & Karl E. Hayes.
