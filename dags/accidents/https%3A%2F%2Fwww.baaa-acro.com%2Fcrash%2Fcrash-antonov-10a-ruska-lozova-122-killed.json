While approaching at a speed of 400-500 km/h with a rate of descent of 6 meters per second, the airplane lost its both wings, dove into the ground and crashed in a wooded area located in Rus'ka Lozova, about 25 km north of Kharkiv-Osnova Airport. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 122 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that a structural failure of the center section lower panel caused the failure of both wings due to fatigue cracks. The rate of descent and the presence of atmospheric turbulences were considered as contributing factors. Investigations revealed that this portion of the aircraft could not be inspected by technicians during a maintenance process due to a faulty conception of the aircraft, thus the fatigue fractures could not be detected in time. Following this tragedy, the Antonov AN-10 would not be operated anymore in passenger service. "}
