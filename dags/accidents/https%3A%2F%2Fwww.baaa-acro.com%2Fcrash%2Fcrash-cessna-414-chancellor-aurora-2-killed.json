While approaching the Denver area the pilot radioed 'can you get me down, it's a little bit icy up here.' The pilot was subsequently asked and was given a close turn onto the outer marker. The aircraft was observed to overfly the airport at about 500 feet agl. The pilot then acknowledge the missed approach instructions, and 1 minute later reported ...'lots of ice...' and '...i'm stalling out...' The pilot reportedly did not like to fly approaches to minimums and set the altitude alerter to an altitude above minimums as a safety margin. The pilot had logged 3.5 hours actual and 4.1 hours simulated instrument time, and 3 instrument approaches in the last 6 months.
