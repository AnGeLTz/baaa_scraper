On final, the aircraft descended below the MDA and, at a speed of 130 knots, struck the ground and crashed in a field located 4 km short of runway 06. The aircraft was totally destroyed. Eight passengers were rescued while 23 other occupants were killed, among them the Brazilian politician Ildefon\u00e7o Cardeiro. ", "probable_cause": "The exact cause of the accident could not be determined with certainty. However, it is believed that the accident was the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain after the crew continued the approach in poor weather conditions and descended below the MDA until the aircraft, in a flaps and gear down configuration, impacted ground. The following contributing factors were identified:\r\n- A difference of 70 feet in the settings was noted between both pilot's altimeters, \r\n- Poor crew coordination,\r\n- Complacency on part of the flying crew caused several deviations from procedures during the approach, \r\n- Lack of crew resources management, \r\n- The crew failed to check the altitude during the final stage of the approach, \r\n- Poor weather conditions.
