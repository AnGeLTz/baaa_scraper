Shortly after take-off, the aircraft was observed flying northbound at a very low altitude above Sabaskong Bay with the engine operating at a high power setting. The aircraft started to climb and bank to the left. The right wing struck the lower of two electrical wires strung across a channel between two islands. The aircraft was destroyed; the pilot sustained fatal injuries.", "probable_cause": "Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors:\r\n1. The power line running overhead the channel was invisible, except at very short range, and was not marked to indicate its presence.\r\n2. The pilot was flying at a very low altitude and likely did not see the power line.\r\nFindings as to Risk:\r\n1. The Standards Obstruction Markings Manual allows for discretion in deciding whether to assess obstructions, making it possible for some obstructions to not be assessed and, consequently, to  not be marked."}
