Despite this, he took the decision to takeoff. Shortly after liftoff, while climbing to a height of 300 feet, the left engine failed. The captain decided to return for a safe landing and elected to reach the closest runway which was occupied by workers. The captain then extended the approach and landed after the roadworks. After touchdown, the airplane was unable to stop within the remaining distance, overran and came to rest. While all three occupants were unhurt, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
