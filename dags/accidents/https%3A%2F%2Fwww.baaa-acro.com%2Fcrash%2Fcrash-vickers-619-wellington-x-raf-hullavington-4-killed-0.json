Shortly after takeoff, while climbing in freezing fog conditions, the airplane encountered difficulties to gain height, hit the corner of a hangar and crashed in flames. All four crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft stalled during initial climb due to an excessive accumulation of frost on all surfaces. It is believed that the crew did not prepare the flight properly and failed to remove the contaminants prior to take off. Accumulation of frost on wings, fuselage and stabilizers increased weight, reduced lift and modified the aerodynamic properties. "}
