At a relative high speed, the pilot-in-command saw a starter ahead prohibiting further taxiing. So the pilot reduced the throttle and attempted to turn to the right when the right main gear collapsed. The airplane came to rest and was damaged beyond repair. There were no casualties. ", "probable_cause": "The direct cause of the accident is the lateral load on the undercarriage while taxiing in a curved trajectory and braking with an excessive speed. Contributing to the undercarriage and spar failure is the weakening of the wheel strength by faulty rivets and aging of the structural material."}
