Impact occurred after the aircraft had turned to the south-southeast and was descending. Minimum descent altitude (MDA) for the approach was 1,680 feet. No preimpact mechanical problems were found. Approximately 4 hours before takeoff, FSS personnel provided a weather briefing. There was no weather reporting station at the destination, but the area forecast was for marginal VMC with isolated visibilities of 3 to 5 miles in light snow showers. Pellston (approximately 25 miles away) was forecast for a chance of 1,200 feet overcast and 3 miles visibility with light snow showers, but this info was not given to the pilot. Later, when the pilot filed an IFR flight plan, he did not update his weather briefing. While en route, he checked the Pellston and Traverse City weather and was advised they had indefinite or obscured ceilings of 1,500 feet or less with gusty winds and light snow squalls. According to witnesses, there were snow showers or squalls in the accident area with 1/4 to 3/4 miles visibility. The missed approach procedure called for: right climbing turn to 3,000 feet, proceed to the IAF (8 miles south of airport) and hold. Both occupants were killed.
