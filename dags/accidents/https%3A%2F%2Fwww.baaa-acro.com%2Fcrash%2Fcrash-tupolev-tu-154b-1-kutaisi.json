In such conditions, he decided to abandon the takeoff procedure and started an emergency braking maneuver. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, lost one main gear and came to rest 781 meters further. All 173 occupants were evacuated, among them 11 were injured. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. It appears that aircraft was overloaded and the CofG was out of the envelope. In such conditions, a rotation was impossible.  ", "probable_cause": "Poor flight preparation on part of the crew and ground operations. The following factors were reported:\r\n- The total weight of the aircraft was well above the MTOW,\r\n- The CofG was too far forward, out of the enveloppe, \r\n- The crew failed to identify the situation in due time."}
