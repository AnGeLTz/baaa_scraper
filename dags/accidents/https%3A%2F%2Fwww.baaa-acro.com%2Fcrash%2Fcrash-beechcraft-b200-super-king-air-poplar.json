After the co-pilot noticed the high decent rate and the slow airspeed, he advised the pilot to add power. However, the airplane continued to descend and impacted terrain in a right wing and nose low attitude, about 30 yards short of the runway approach threshold, which resulted in substantial damage to the right wing. The pilot reported that there were no preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions with the airplane that would have precluded normal operation.", "probable_cause": "The pilot\u2019s failure to maintain adequate airspeed and descent rate during the landing approach, which resulted in an impact with terrain short of the runway threshold."}
