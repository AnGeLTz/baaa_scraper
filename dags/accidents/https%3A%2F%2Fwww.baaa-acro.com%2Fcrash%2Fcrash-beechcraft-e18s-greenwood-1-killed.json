A witness heard a noise and observed flames coming from the right engine cowling as the airplane climbed. The airplane entered a turn after climbing about 200 feet, descended through a small grove of trees, crashed in a pasture, and burned. During takeoff, the plane's gross weight was about 11,050 lbs and the cg was behind the aft limit. Its maximum certified weight limit was 9,700 lbs. The pilot was aware of a gross weight problem before takeoff. An exam revealed evidence that the left engine propeller was in the feathered position and the right propeller was not feathered at impact. A check of the right engine disclosed that the n\u00b03 cylinder intake valve had failed from fatigue. The pilot, sole on board, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper emergency procedure by shutting down the wrong engine, which resulted in a forced landing. Factors related to the accident were: failure of the number three intake valve in the right engine due to fatigue, and trees in the emergency landing area."}
