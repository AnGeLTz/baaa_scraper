At 1155LT, the pilot reported he was flying at a height of some 500 feet in poor visibility. Less than 15minutes later, while cruising at an altitude of 1,500 feet, he saw the mountain at the last moment and tried to gain altitude. Unfortunately, the aircraft impacted the slope of Mount Fair Snape Fell located some 30 km northeast of Blackpool and was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire. Both occupants were killed. It appears the aircraft impacted the mountain 200 feet below the summit and the correction made by the pilot was too late to avoid terrain. At the time of the accident, the visibility was poor due to mist. \r\nCrew:\r\nCedric Rex Crow, pilot.\r\nPassenger:\r\nRonald Swales.", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain. "}
