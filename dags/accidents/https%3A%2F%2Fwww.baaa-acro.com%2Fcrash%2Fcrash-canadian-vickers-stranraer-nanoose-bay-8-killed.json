The pilot apparently endeavored to effect a landing on exceeding water off Nanoose Bay. The left wing tip apparently dropped and came in contact with a large wave causing the aircraft to slew violently to the left and force the nose into the water crashing the forward part of the hull and breaking all cockpit windows. The aircraft then sank nose first in approximately four minutes. Wing tip and tailplane only visible during this period of time. All eight crew members were killed and the body of the pilot was found four days later. \r\nCrew:\r\nF/Lt Donald Clark MacDougall, pilot, \r\nSgt Gordon Herbert Andrews, pilot,\r\nSgt Russell Tremaine Mitchell, navigator, \r\nAC1 Robert William Adams, observer, \r\nLAC William Dennis Riley, observer,\r\nAC1 Robert Albert Blakely, wireless operator, \r\nSgt John Cunningham Gunn, wireless operator, \r\nP/O Richard Wood, wireless operator.", "probable_cause": "Heavy landing in extremely rough water during a gale.
