The pilot stated he added power and executed a normal approach at 120 knots, compensating for downdrafts/crosswinds. After touchdown, the pilot said he did not get a beta light on the right engine. He stated he brought the power levers 'behind the gate into reverse.' The aircraft drifted left. The pilot said he corrected with brakes and nosewheel steering. He applied takeoff power and the aircraft veered right, and ran off the right side of the runway. The aircraft collided with a dirt bank and then trees. Three tire skid marks were observed on the right side of the runway. A pilot-witness said winds were gusting 22-25 knots, variable from 130-220\u00b0. He said the aircraft landed fast and long. Examination of the engines and props revealed no evidence of malfunction. The engine manufacturer recommends prop reverse not be used on icy runway or when beta light on one engine does not illuminate. The aircraft manufacturer advises that nosewheel steering should not be used at speeds below 40 knots. All six occupants were injured, two seriously.
