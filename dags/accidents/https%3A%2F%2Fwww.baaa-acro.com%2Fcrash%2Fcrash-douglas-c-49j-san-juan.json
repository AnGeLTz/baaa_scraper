They raised the landing gear but failed to feather the left propeller and failed to trim the aircraft. The resulting skid and increased drag made further flight impossible. The crew elected to ditch the aircraft in a lagoon about 2 miles southwest of the airport. The aircraft was not recovered from the lagoon and therefore it was not determined why the left engine lost power. Both pilots escaped with minor injuries. ", "probable_cause": "The failure of the flight crew to feather the left propeller and trim the aircraft after the left engine stopped producing power for undetermined reasons."}
