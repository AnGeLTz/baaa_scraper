During the takeoff roll in poor weather conditions (snowfall and poor visibility), the pilot-in-command started the rotation. The aircraft lifted off and climbed for few meters when the left wing dropped, causing the left main gear to struck the runway surface. The airplane landed back and the crew decided to attempt an emergency braking procedure. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran and the left wing collided with the building of a meteorological post located 25 metres behind the runway threshold. All 3 crew and 14 passengers escaped unhurt.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the aircraft was contaminated with snow during the takeoff procedure and that the stabs were positioned in a -5,9\u00b0 angle instead of the prescribed -3,9\u00b0."}
