While passing over the airfield at a relative low altitude, it collided with a Bell P-63 Kingcobra that was engaged in the same manoeuvre and coming from its left. The B-17 was cut in two, entered an uncontrolled descent and crashed in a field, bursting into flames. The P-63 was also destroyed. All six people in both aircraft were killed. At the time of the collision, the B-17 was following a straight-in course while the P-63 was supposed to cut its trajectory behind. Obviously, the pilot of the P-63 misjudged the situation.
