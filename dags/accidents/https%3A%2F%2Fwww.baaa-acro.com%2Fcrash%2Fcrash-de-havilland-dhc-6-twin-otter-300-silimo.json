Out of control, the airplane veered to the left and came to rest in a ditch. All three occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. The Silimo's runway is 560 metres long and 20 metres wide. Its surface is in gravel and it has a gradient of 9\u00b0. Due to the environmental topography, a go-around procedure is not possible on short final and the area is subject to strong currents that can change rapidly and brutally.  ", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the loss of height on short final was the consequence of sudden change in the wind direction and speed. "}
