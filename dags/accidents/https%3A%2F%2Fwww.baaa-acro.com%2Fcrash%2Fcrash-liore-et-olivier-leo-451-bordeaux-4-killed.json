As four LeO 45 (n\u00b0157, 169, 181 & 190) were parked at Bordeaux-M\u00e9rignac Airport,  the crew stole one of them to reach the front line. One of the crew took his bicycle with him but as it was not properly stored in the cabin, it shifted rearward upon liftoff, causing the elevator system to be jammed. The pilot lost control of the airplane that crashed in a wooded area just past the runway end, bursting into flames.
