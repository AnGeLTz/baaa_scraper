While descending to S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, the captain led the controls to the copilot who was still under instruction. On final, the aircraft was too high on the glide. The captain took over controls but his reaction was excessive. The aircraft suddenly rolled to the right, causing the right wing to struck the ground few dozen metres short of runway 15 threshold.
