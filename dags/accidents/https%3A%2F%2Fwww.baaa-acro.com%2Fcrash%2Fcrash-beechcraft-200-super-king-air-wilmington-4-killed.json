Examination of the engines revealed that the left engine failed because of a fatigue failure of a compressor turbine blade. Examination of the right engine revealed no evidence of malfunction that would have prevented the use of full power. The aircrew was experienced and well trained. The radar data confirmed a drop in airspeed just before the airplane contacted the trees. All four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's improper execution of an emergency procedure, after an engine failure, which resulted in a loss of airspeed and subsequent stall at an altitude too low for recovery. A factor related to the accident was the fatigue failure of a compressor turbine blade and the subsequent engine failure."}
