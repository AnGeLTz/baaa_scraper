En route to airport, engine lost power completely. On base leg for forced landing (off airport) fire broke out in engine area and burned through hydraulic line causing gear to extend. Due to increased glide angle, planned flight path would not clear obstruction (Draw Bridge). When the pilot maneuvered to avoid the obstacle, the aircraft stalled, mushed and collided with a boat dock. Investigation revealed a loose fuel line fitting. The pilot, sole on board, was seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (partial) - mech failure/malf\r\nPhase of operation: cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
