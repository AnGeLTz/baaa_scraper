", "probable_cause": "Undershoot and collision with approach lights on final approach due to improper IFR operation. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Incorrect altimeter setting, \r\n- Misjudged distance and altitude, \r\n- Low ceiling, \r\n- Rain,\r\n- Fog,\r\n- Altitude found at setting that would cause aircraft to be 180 feet lower than indicated."}
