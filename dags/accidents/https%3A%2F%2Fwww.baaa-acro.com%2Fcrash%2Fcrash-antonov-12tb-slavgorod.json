The captain realized this would not be possible and attempted an emergency landing in an open field located 8,6 km from the airport. The aircraft landed in a flapless and gear up configuration. Upon touchdown, the tail separated and the aircraft slid for few dozen metres before coming to rest, bursting into flames. All six occupants were injured, four of them seriously.
