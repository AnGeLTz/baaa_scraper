Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed. Prior to departure, the pilot was given an ifr clearance void time from an ARTCC. The pilot was climbing toward a VOR located about 27 miles southeast of the departure airport while attempting to contact the ARTCC to open his instrument flight plan. The pilot failed to maintain terrain clearance, and became lost/disoriented. The airplane struck trees and snow covered terrain at 10,200 feet msl, 7 nautical miles and about 22\u00b0 to the right of the intended course. Four passengers were killed while two other occupants, among them the pilot, were injured. ", "probable_cause": "The failure of the pilot to plan and conduct his departure flight to avoid high mountainous terrain, during which the pilot became lost/disoriented. Contributing to the accident was self induced pressure to depart before the arrival of a snow storm."}
