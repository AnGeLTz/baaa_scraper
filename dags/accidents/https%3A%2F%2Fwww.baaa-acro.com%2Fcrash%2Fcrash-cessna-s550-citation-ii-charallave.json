During the second attempt to land, the aircraft landed long and the touchdown point appeared to be half way down the runway 10 which is 2,000 meters long. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, went down an embankment and came to rest. All eight occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
