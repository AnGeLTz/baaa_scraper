The engine continued to operate indicating 24 inches of manifold pressure. All other instruments were normal but what looked like a brown stain developed on top of the right wing along the spar cap near the tip tank. Artcc was advised that a precautionary landing would be made at Raton and a rapid descent was begun. On final the right engine nacelle and wing locker turned brown. As the aircraft landed flames appeared on the right side of the fuselage and smoke entered the cabin. Both engines were secured and brakes applied. The brakes were inoperative therefore, the pilot steered the aircraft off the runway into a snowbank collapsing the nose gear. Within 15 mins most of the wreckage was consumed by the fire. Ignition source and fire origination point were not determined. All three occupants escaped uninjured.
