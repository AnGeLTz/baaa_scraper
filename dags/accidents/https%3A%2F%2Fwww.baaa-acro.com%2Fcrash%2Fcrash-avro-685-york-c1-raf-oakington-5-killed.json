While flying over the airfield at an altitude of some 150 feet, the aircraft stalled and crashed in a huge explosion. All five crew members were killed. \r\nCrew (242nd Squadron):\r\nF/Lt Douglas S. Cameron, \r\nF/Lt Basil C. Hanson,\r\nF/Lt John D. Hughes,\r\n2nd Cl Raymond B. Hollis,\r\nF/O George H. Salt. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that, when the crew attempted to go around, he failed to increase power on all three remaining engines number two, three and four. In the mean time, the crew prematurely retracted the trailing edge flaps. The combination of a premature flap retraction and an insufficient engine power caused the aircraft to stall. Due to an insufficient distance between the aircraft and the ground, a recovery was not possible. "}
