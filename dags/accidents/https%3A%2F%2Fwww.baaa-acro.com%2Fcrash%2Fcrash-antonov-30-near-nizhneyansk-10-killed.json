While in cruising altitude by night, the aircraft suffered violent oscillations and started to pitch up and down. It entered an uncontrolled descent and at an altitude of 2,000 metres, it partially disintegrated and eventually crashed at a speed of 670 km/h in an icy river. All 10 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew disengaged and re-engaged several times the automatic pilot system for unknown reasons. This created tail and elevators' movements and the reaction of the crew was inappropriate. The aircraft suffered violent oscillations on both roll and pitch axis then entered an uncontrolled descent. The partial disintegration was the consequence of aerodynamic forces that exceeded the aircraft certification. "}
