The aircraft was destroyed and all 25 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The probable cause of the accident was the wrong execution of a left turn at low altitude at night, as a result of which the aircraft stalled, lost its maneuverability and went into a spin. Contributing factor: As a consequence of having had alcoholic drinks and insufficient sleep the night before the accident, the pilot was not considered to be in a satisfactory mental and physical condition to undertake the flight. For the same reason, the copilot should not have been allowed to start on the flight in question."}
