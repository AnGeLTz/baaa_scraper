The sole occupants were the pilot and an observer. Following an ILS approach to runway 23 at Stansted Airport an overshoot (go-around) was initiated and at about 200 feet the starboard engine cut out. The commander attempted unsuccessfully to restart the engine by use of the starter motor. The aircraft lost speed and height and crashed just outside the airport. The observer was killed and the pilot injured. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by the pilot failing to feather the propeller and raise the flaps after the starboard engine had cut during an overshoot manoeuvre. A contributory factor is considered to have been the absence of any prescribed procedure in the Flight Manual to meet this eventuality. The reason for the malfunction of the starboard engine both during the stall test and later during the overshoot could not be determined. "}
