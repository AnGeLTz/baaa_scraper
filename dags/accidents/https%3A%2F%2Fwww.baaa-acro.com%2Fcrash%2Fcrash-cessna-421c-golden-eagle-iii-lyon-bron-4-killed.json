Shortly after passing the end of the runway, the airplane lost height then struck the ground and caught fire. The airplane was destroyed by a post crash fire and all four occupants were killed. For unknown reasons, the pilot-in-command was seating in the right seat.", "probable_cause": "The accident probably occurred as a result of an asymmetrical flight starting from the rotation that the pilot was not able to control. As technical examinations and observations from the wreckage could not give any conclusive malfunction of the engines or systems, the initial cause is most likely an improper adjustment of the steering trim before takeoff. The poor experience of the pilot on this high powered and complex aircraft as well as the low height reached did not allow the pilot to understand and manage the situation quickly and avoid the loss of control."}
