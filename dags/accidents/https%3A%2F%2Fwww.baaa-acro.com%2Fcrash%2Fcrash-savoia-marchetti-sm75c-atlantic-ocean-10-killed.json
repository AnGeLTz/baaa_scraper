It departed Natal Airport at 0800LT on the leg to Sal, Cape Verde, carrying a crew of four, six passengers and the diplomatic mail. At 1125LT, while overflying the Atlantic Ocean, the crew reported technical problems with the central engine that had to be shut down. At 1146LT, the crew sent a mayday message and 10 minutes later, he informed ATC that the situation on board was difficult. Less than 10 minutes later, the aircraft went out of control and crashed into the sea. Important SAR operations were conducted on an area located some 185 km off the island of Fernando de Noronha. All operations were eventually suspended on January 22 as no trace of the aircraft nor the 10 occupants was found.
