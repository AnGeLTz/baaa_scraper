Shortly later, the airplane went out of control and crashed in flames in a prairie located in Alma, Georgia. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and both crew members were killed. Prior to the crash the fire was observed by ground witnesses when it burned through the fuselage, allowing burning cargo and debris to be scattered over a large area. After making several left circles, the burning aircraft plunged to the ground.", "probable_cause": "The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the ignition of cargo in the aft belly compartment caused by contact with an unguarded light bulb. It is believed the fire then breached the compartment wall, and damaged a hydraulic unit or line in the wing center section area at the rear spar., igniting the flammable hydraulic fluid."}
