Nevertheless, investigators pinpointed the following findings: \r\n- The captain was distracted while the first officer was looking for different radio frequencies,\r\n- Apparent failure of some instruments,\r\n- A sudden power loss on two engines on the same side of the plane, #1 & 2 or # 3 & 4, \r\n- Engagement of the autopilot system by a person not entitled to do so, apparently by a person other than the two pilots,\r\n- A lateral loss of control as a result of the malfunction of flaps that have been deployed in an asymmetric position,\r\n- Technical issue on the primary control system,\r\n- A structural failure that probably occurred on the extremity of both wings and on the tail simultaneously."}
