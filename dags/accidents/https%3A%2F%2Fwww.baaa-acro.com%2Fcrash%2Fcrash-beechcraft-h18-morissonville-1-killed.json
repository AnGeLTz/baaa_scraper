Visual exam of the aircraft revealed ice accumulations on the leading edges and upper wing surfaces. The pilot attempted to get deice equipment, which was not available. The pilot was offered use of a hangar which he declined. The airport manager was en route to check runway condition for plowing the ice and snow covered runway when the pilot returned to the aircraft. An unsuccessful attempt was made to remove ice from the leading edges by hand. The pilot decided to attempt another takeoff and at this time was almost 1/2 hour beyond his scheduled departure time. Liftoff was approximately 1/5 of way down and after flying at 50 feet agl initiated climb. After attaining an altitude of several hundred feet, the aircraft stalled and descended uncontrolled to impact. The aircraft was destroyed by impact and fire and the pilot was fatally injured.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
