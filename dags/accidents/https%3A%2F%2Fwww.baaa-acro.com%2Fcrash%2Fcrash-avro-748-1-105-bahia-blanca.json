The crew was informed by ATC that the visibility was reduced to 200 meters due to fog which means below minima. The captain decided to attempt an approach to runway 34. After passing the middle marker, he was able to see the runway lights so he decided to continue the approach under visual mode. Shortly later, he lost visual contact when the airplane struck the ground about 25 meters short of runway threshold and 200 meters to the left of the extended centerline. On impact, the right wing was torn off and the airplane lost its undercarriage before coming to rest. All 39 occupants were evacuated safely. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the captain who decided to land in below-minima weather conditions. "}
