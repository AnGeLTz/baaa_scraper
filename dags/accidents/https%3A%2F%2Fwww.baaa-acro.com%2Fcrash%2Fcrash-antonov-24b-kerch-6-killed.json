On approach, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with fog, clouds down to 100 meters above the ground and a visibility limited to 500 meters. On final, at a speed of 220 km/h, the pilot-in-command decided to reduced his altitude to establish a visual contact with the ground when the airplane struck a concrete block of a power line. Flying at a height of 17 meters below the runway altitude, the airplane struck a house and crashed in flames some 2,610 meters short of runway. All four crew members and two passengers were killed while five other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The crew continued the approach below the glide without visual contact with the runway and ground. The accident was caused by the combination of the following factors: \r\n- Overestimation of the vertical speed,\r\n- Poor altimeter monitoring,\r\n- Possible wrong altimeter setting,\r\n- Absence of a radar at the airport allowing ATC to monitor the aircraft's approach path,\r\n- Low visibility due to fog,\r\n- Lack of information regarding weather conditions at destination."}
