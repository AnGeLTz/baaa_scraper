About an hour after departure from Nizhnetambovskoye, while in cruising altitude, the pilot noted a leak on the right engine, between cylinders n\u00b07 and 8. Shortly later, the right engine stopped and the crew decided to attempt an emergency landing on the Amur River. At the time of the accident, the water was glassy and upon landing some 700 metres offshore, the airplane crashed, overturned and sank. All four crew members were rescued by fishermen while all three passengers drowned. ", "probable_cause": "The following factors were identified:\r\n- The right engine failed in flight, maybe after the mechanic turned off the ignition system, \r\n- The speed of the airplane upon landing was excessive,\r\n- The glassy water of the Amur River,\r\n- The pilot was confused due the failure of the engine, \r\n- The inappropriate position of the stabilizers.
