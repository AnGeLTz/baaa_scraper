At 2026LT the crew reported that he was diverting to La Rioja Airport as it was impossible to approach C\u00f3rdoba due to poor weather conditions with heavy turbulences. At 2125Lt the crew reported to ATC about an ETA at La Rioja at 2140LT. Shortly later, the aircraft hit the slope of a mountain located in the Sierra de Vilgo, near the village of Aman\u00e1. The wreckage was found three days later and all 25 occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "For reasons which could not be determined the aircraft deviated from the prescribed route and followed a course which led it to crash in mountainous terrain. A contributing factor was the pilot-in-command's decision to descend below the minimum altitude specified for weather conditions requiring an instrument approach, contrary to the provisions of the Airline Operations Manual. A probable contributing factor was the probable fatigue of the aircraft crew."}
