On final, the aircraft was too high on the glide and landed too far down the runway. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, it overran, struck an embankment and came to rest 120 meters further. All five occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who continued the approach above the glide following an erratic appreciation of the situation. This caused the aircraft to land too far down the runway at an excessive speed. At the time of the accident, the runway surface was wet and the wind was gusting from 240\u00b0 at 30 knots."}
