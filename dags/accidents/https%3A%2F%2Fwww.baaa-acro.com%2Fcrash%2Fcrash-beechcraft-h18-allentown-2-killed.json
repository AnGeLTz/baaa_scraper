He diverted toward Allentown, PA, then advised he had lost power in the left engine. Approach control began issuing vectors for a VOR approach; however, the pilot advised he was unable to open his approach plates and requested a surveillance radar approach. Radar vectors and advisories were provided until the pilot reported he had the airport in sight. Several witnesses observed that the left prop was feathered as the aircraft approached the airport. The pilot maneuvered the aircraft to a left downwind for runway 24 at about 400 feet agl with the landing gear extended. Witnesses reported the aircraft's nose pitch up, then down, then the aircraft rolled to the left and crashed. In a trailer court it hit a mobile home and a propane tank and burned. A person in the mobile home was fatally injured. An exam of the wreckage revealed the left prop blades were at the low pitch stops. No preimpact failures were found.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight encounter with weather\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
