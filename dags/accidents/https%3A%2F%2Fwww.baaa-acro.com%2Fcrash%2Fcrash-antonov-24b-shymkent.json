On approach, at an altitude of about 300 metres, the instructor shut down one engine to simulate a failure. The pilot-in-command requested full power on the remaining engine but the flight engineer misinterpreted the instruction and shut down the second engine. The aircraft lost speed and height and struck the ground with a positive acceleration of 2,6 g before coming to rest in a field 1,100 metres short of runway threshold. All four occupants were injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
