The aircraft was near maximum weight and the temperature was high. He had planned a \u201cgo, no go\u201d position and reported that the aircraft was on the step by this point. He realised himself that the takeoff would be successful. The pilot initiated a climb before a safe speed was reached and the aircraft did not accelerate properly. In order to avoid high terrain the pilot commenced a turn to the right. The aircraft began to mush and then stalled on the lake surface. The passengers stated that because there were no seats available they sat on top of the cargo.\r\nSource: www.dhc-2.com", "probable_cause": null}
