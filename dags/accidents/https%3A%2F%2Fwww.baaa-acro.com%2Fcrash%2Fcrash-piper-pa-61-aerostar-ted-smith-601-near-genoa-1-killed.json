At 1530 on 12/12/84, he departed on a flight to Corona, CA with refueling stops at Albuquerque, NM and Phoenix, AZ. He departed Phoenix at 2100, but encountered weather and returned to Phoenix where he refueled again and obtained a lengthy weather briefing. He then elected to return to his home airport at Carson City and took off at 2351. When the aircraft did not arrive, a search was initiated. Radar data revealed an unidentified target that disappeared near Genoa, NV. During a search in that area, the wreckage was found where the aircraft had crashed near the top of a mountain about 5 miles north of the pilot's home. The elevation was approximately 9,050 feet. Impact occurred on a westerly heading, about 2 hours before moonset, on the shaded side of the mountain, in a near wings level attitude. No preimpact/mechanical malfunction/failure was found, both engines/propellers showed evidence of power. The pilot's wife said he sometimes flew over their house to let her know he would be home soon. Complete autopsy/tox check not possible.
