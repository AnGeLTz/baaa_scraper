While approaching the coast at a height of 100 meters, the pilot initiated a turn to the right to 270\u00b0 when the aircraft struck the rocky face of a mountain (145 meters high) overhanging the sea. The aircraft disintegrated on impact and all 10 occupants were killed.", "probable_cause": "For unknown reasons, the crew was approaching the coast at an insufficient altitude. At the time of the accident, the visibility was limited so the crew was unable to see and avoid the mountain. It was determined that the turn to 270\u00b0 was initiated 1,2 km from the coast while this procedure should be completed 10 km away from the coast. In such conditions, impact with the ground was unavoidable. "}
