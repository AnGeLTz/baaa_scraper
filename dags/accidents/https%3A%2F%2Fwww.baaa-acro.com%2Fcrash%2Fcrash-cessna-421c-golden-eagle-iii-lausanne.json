It overran, rolled through a cornfield, crossed a motorway and came to rest against a dirt bank, bursting into flames. All four occupants were injured, the pilot seriously. The aircraft was totally destroyed by a post crash fire. ", "probable_cause": "The aircraft was unable to reach the necessary takeoff speed for reasons that could not be determined with certainty. It is possible that the parking brake was still ON during the takeoff procedure as braking traces from both main gears were found on the runway and the cornfield as well. The pilot realized too late he could not takeoff, and a relative soft ground and heavy aircraft were considered as contributing factors. "}
