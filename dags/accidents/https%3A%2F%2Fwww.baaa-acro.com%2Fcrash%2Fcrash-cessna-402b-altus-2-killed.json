A witness described the 1st backfired as 'the loudest I have ever heard.' When the aircraft took off, two persons living near the departure end of the runway noted that the aircraft (believed to be the same) sounded different and had a 'cluttering sound'. While climbing, the pilot declared an emergency and reported a fire in the left engine. He was vectored toward Altus AFB while descending in IFR conditions. He descended into VFR conditions and saw the airport about 3 miles away. A witness saw smoke and fire trailing from the vicinity of the left engine. He stated that the aircraft's nose came up, the plane rolled to the left, then it entered a steep, nose down, inverted attitude just before it crashed and burned. An exam revealed the engine exhaust manifold header assy had failed and allowed hot exhaust gases to escape in the engine nacelle in the vicinity of fuel and oil lines. Corrosion had progressed thru the header assy. Ad 75-23-08 requested general inspection, but contained note 'do not remove clamps.' No record of replacement in 6,100 hours.
