After touchdown on runway 18, the crew started the braking procedure when the airplane was struck by the AN-32 from behind. After collision, both airplanes went out of control and came to rest on the runway edge. There were no casualties while both aircraft were destroyed. It appears that the AN-32 landed shortly after the AN-26 and was unable to stop in a timely manner. ", "probable_cause": null}
