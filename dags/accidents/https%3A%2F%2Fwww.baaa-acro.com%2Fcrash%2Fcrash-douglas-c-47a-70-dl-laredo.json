He attempted to restore takeoff power while applying forward pressure on the control yoke, but lost control of the aircraft and impacted the terrain adjacent to the departure runway. He further stated that the cargo may have shifted to the rear of the aircraft during takeoff. The aircraft was destroyed and both pilots were seriously injured. ", "probable_cause": "The pic's disregard for the security of the cargo that permitted its shift during the takeoff roll. This resulted in an aft cg situation and a subsequent stall and loss of aircraft control. A contributing factor in the accident was the mismanagement of the engine power by the crew and the lack of experience of the copilot. \r\nOccurrence #1: cargo shift\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
