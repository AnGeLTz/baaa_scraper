The crew decided to takeoff from runway 01. During the takeoff roll, the airplane was caught by strong winds and control was lost. The airplane veered off runway, lost its undercarriage and came to rest in flames. Both pilots were injured and the aircraft was destroyed by fire. ", "probable_cause": "The crew selected the wrong runway relative to existing wind. The following factors were considered as contributing: \r\n- Unfavorable wind component,\r\n- Inadequate preflight preparation, \r\n- Improperly loaded aircraft (W&B and CofG), \r\n- Overload failure, \r\n- Wind gusting up to 23 knots,\r\n- Aircraft loaded aft of CofG."}
