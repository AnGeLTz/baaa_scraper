The pilot made a turn to the left and attempted to make an emergency landing on a beach when the aircraft hit a coconut tree and crashed. The pilot was injured while five other occupants were unhurt. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. \r\nTestimony from the pilot:\r\n\"I drained both fuel tanks for water prior to take-off, but apparently there was still water in one. I had 5 passengers on board. I took off without trouble, but the instant we were off the starboard engine began misfiring, and it lost power fast. Because of the country I commenced a left turn, into the live engine, to try to reach the beach, but I couldn't make it. I put her down on a bit of a clearing in a sacsac swamp. The starboard wing bit a coconut palm and we slewed right around. I banged my head somewhere and got a cut scalp. The passengers were alright though. She burst into flames - was a write-off.\"\r\nSource: \r\nhttp://www.goodall.com.au/australian-aviation/dh84-pt2/dh84-dragon-pt2.htm", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the failure of the right engine was caused by the contamination of fuel by water.
