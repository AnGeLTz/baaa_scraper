On final, the pilot-in-command decided to make a go around. Few minutes later, a second attempt to land was also abandoned and during the third attempt, the aircraft was too low, hit the ground and crashed in a field located 6 km short of runway. All four crew members were injured and the aircraft was written off. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot decided to continue the third approach at a too low altitude in gusty winds, below the minimum prescribed altitude. Poor weather conditions were considered as a contributory factor, as well as the fact that the ground lighting system was insufficient, especially in adverse weather conditions. "}
