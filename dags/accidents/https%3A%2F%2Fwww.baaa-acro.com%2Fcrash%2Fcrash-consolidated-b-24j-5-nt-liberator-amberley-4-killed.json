Unfortunately the B-24 Liberator's brakes were applied too soon before the aircraft was safely in the air. As a consequence the nose of the aircraft dipped heavily into the runway causing the nose wheel assembly to collapse and also shearing the hydraulic lines for the engine controls. The aircraft subsequently skidded off the south east end of the runway into a 60 feet deep gulley and broke in half.\r\nCrew (99th Squadron):\r\nS/Ldr William Lloyd Milne, pilot\r\nW/O Eric Ferdinand Carlson, copilot, \u2020\r\nF/Sgt Jack Grant Watson, flight engineer,\r\nF/Sgt Marcel Kingsley Doolan, radar operator,\r\nF/Sgt Warwick Manning Lane, air gunner, \r\nF/Sgt Andrew Keith Cochrane, wireless operator and air gunner, \r\nF/Sgt Allan Charles Annetts, air gunner, \r\nF/Sgt Arthur Henry Clausen, navigator. \u2020\r\nPassengers:\r\nSgt John Raymond Slennett\r\nSgt John Knyvett\r\nCpl Jacqueline Ruth Row, \u2020\r\nCpl Edith Tansley Sharpe, \u2020\r\nAcw Ruth Beryl Burcher,\r\nLAC Waterman James Albert\r\nLAC William Angus Ludbey,\r\nAC1 Keith William Carlier,\r\nLAC Douglas Charles Mighell,\r\nLAC Leslie Arthur White,\r\nLAC Mervyn John Edward Thornberry.\r\nSource: http://www.ozatwar.com/ozcrashes/qld245.htm", "probable_cause": null}
