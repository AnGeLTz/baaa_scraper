While flying south of Marseille at an altitude of 1,000 feet, the aircraft hit the slope of a mountain and was destroyed upon impact. On the scene, rescuers were able to evacuate a passenger seriously injured while 25 other occupants were killed. Few hours later, the only survivor died from his injuries. At the time of the accident, the visibility was poor due to snow falls and the aircraft was following a wrong path. \r\nCrew (271st Squadron):\r\nF/Lt William George Elliott Buchanan, pilot,\r\nF/Sgt Edwin Alan Chapman, copilot,\r\nW/O John Wyvill Suart, navigator,\r\nF/O Ralph Nathaniel Smith, wireless operator.\r\nPassengers:\r\nLAC Stephen Michael Aungier, \r\nLAC John Kendal Bond, \r\nDrv Henry Canham, \r\nLAC Charles George Cottle, \r\nLAC Henry Cunningham, \r\nLAC Gwilym Daniels, \r\nLAC Ernest John Fessi, \r\nPvt John James Flanagan, \r\nLAC Leonard Roy Fouracre, \r\nSap Eric Gardham, \r\nLAC Trevor Ernest Giles, \r\nLAC Ronald Gillingham, \r\nCpt Paul Verrier Isaac, \r\nCpt Wilfred Kendrick Lloyd, \r\nLt Peter Marriott, \r\nLt John Harold Nutt, \r\nCpl Walter Peacock, \r\nPvt Benjamin Price, \r\nLt Maurice Ernest Rennie, \r\nLt Robert Thomas Tobias, \r\nLt Stanley Charles Turner, \r\nCpt George Wood.", "probable_cause": "It appears that the aircraft was off course at the time of the accident following erroneous information received by the crew from the ground control service. Due to low visibility caused by snow falls, the crew was unable to distinguish the mountainous area and this resulted in a controlled flight into terrain. "}
