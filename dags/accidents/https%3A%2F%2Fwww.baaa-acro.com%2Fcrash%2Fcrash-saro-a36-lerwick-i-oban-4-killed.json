Approaching Oban, the pilot decided to land well out in the Firth of Lorne due to poor visibility. Apparently owing to an error in judgment, he stalled the aircraft onto the water, causing it to bounce several times some 5 miles west of Oban off the lighthouse, at the southern point of Lismore Island. In doing this, the starboard wing tip float was knocked off and the aircraft heeled over, causing water to enter through the windows. All the crew managed to get out into the water before the aircraft sank. Unfortunately, the pilot was killed while three other crew members were missing.\r\nCrew (209th Squadron):\r\nF/S George A. Corby, pilot, \u2020\r\nP/O W. E. Ogle-Skan,\r\nAC2 Taylor,\r\nAC1 Richard J. Webber, \u2020\r\nAC2 Lawrence H.
