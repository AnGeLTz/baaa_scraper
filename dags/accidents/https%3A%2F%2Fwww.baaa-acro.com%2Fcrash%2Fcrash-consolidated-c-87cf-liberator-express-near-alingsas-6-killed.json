This was some sort of secret operation. It seems that the plane was a part of Operation Carpetbagger, which was a special program to deliver supplies to resistance groups in enemy-occupied countries, to deliver personnel to the field, and occasionally to bring back personnel from the field. It is believed that this plane was being used to fly back to the UK Norwegian aircrew trainees and American internees from Sweden. En route to Stockholm-Bromma and while flying over Sweden, the crew encountered poor weather conditions and low visibility due to fog. The group of five airplanes decided to divert to G\u00f6teborg Airport when flying at an altitude of some 300 feet, the four engine aircraft hit a hill located near Alings\u00e5s, some 50 km northeast of G\u00f6teborg. All six crew members were killed. \nCrew:\nCpt Truett K. Bullock, pilot,\n1st Lt Paul R. Buchanan,\nT/Sgt Donald J. Johnston, radio operator,\nCpt Colin T. Campbell, navigator,\nCpt Earl K.
