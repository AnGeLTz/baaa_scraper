The forward fuselage and cabin broke away and fell 70 feet to the ground, the cargo spilling out of the shattered cabin. Crisp was not injured but was strapped into the remains of the cockpit in the tree tops. Crisp climbed down the trees to the ground to camp in torrential rain and began walking out next day. He was found by a searching ground party the following day.", "probable_cause": null}
