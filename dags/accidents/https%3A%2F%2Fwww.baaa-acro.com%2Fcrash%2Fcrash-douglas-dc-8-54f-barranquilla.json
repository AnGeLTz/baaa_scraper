The captain attempted to veer off runway to the left but on a wet surface, the aircraft overran the runway, lost two engines and its undercarriage before coming to rest. All four crew members evacuated safely while the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who landed too far down the runway. In such conditions, the landing distance available was insufficient. The crew failed to initiate a go around.
