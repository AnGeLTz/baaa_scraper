The flight began at Midland, TX and proceeded to Fort Worth and Wichita Falls, TX, then began a return flight to Midland. During arrival, the pilot transmitted that he was turning on a 1/2 mile final approach for runway 16R. Witnesses observed what appeared to be a normal approach, but at 30 to 50 feet agl, the pilot initiated a go-around, the aircraft pitched up in an extremely nose high attitude, then entered a left bank, stalled and crashed. To duplicate the aircraft's observed profile, simulation tests showed full aft yoke pressure had to have been applied with full nose-up trim engaged thru-out the maneuver. No preexisting mechanical defects were found during the investigation. A test of the right front seat passenger's blood showed a blood/alcohol level of .144%. A test of the pilot's blood showed no drugs or alcohol, but a microscopic tissue exam showed changes possibly indicative of myocardial infarction; no cause of an infarction was conclusively established. All eight occupants were killed. \n", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: go-around (VFR)\r\nFindings\r\n1. Light condition - dark night\r\n2.
