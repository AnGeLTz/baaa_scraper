On short final, at a height of about 500 feet, control was lost and the aircraft crashed in a wooded area located 2 km short of runway. All eight occupants were injured while the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a loss of control on short final following the combination of the following factors:\r\n- An elevator cable probably broke away due to a progressive wear combined with a damaged pulley,\r\n- The proximity of the terrain,\r\n- The low speed of the aircraft,\r\n- The lack of crew training in such situation,\r\n- The loss of control of the aircraft occurred at a critical phase of the flight, initially caused by a mechanical failure and later to human factors."}
