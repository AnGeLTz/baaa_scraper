At a height of 100 meters, the crew elected to restart the right engine but the propeller went into pitch position, causing high drag. The airplane lost height and crashed in a cotton field located 34 km south of Tashkent-Yuzhny Airport. 29 people were wounded while nine passengers were killed. A day later, two other passengers died from their injuries. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the second cylinder on the right engine due to poor manufacturing.
