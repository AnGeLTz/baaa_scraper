Due to excessive g loads, the right wing detached then the airplane crashed in a field located near Balad, about 38 km northeast of Mogadishu Airport, eight minutes after takeoff. All 50 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that aircraft had entered a spiral dive after encountering strong vertical gusts.
