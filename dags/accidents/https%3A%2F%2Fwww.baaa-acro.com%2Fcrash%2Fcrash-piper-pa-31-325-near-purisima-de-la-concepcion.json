After takeoff from Tol\u00fa, the pilot decided to position to Monter\u00eda-Los Garzones Airport. Shortly after takeoff, the pilot encountered engine problems and elected to make an emergency landing in a pasture. Upon landing, the right wing collided with obstacles then the nose gear collapsed and the aircraft came to rest near Pur\u00edsima de la Concepci\u00f3n, about 10 km east of Tol\u00fa. The pilot was uninjured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Inadequate fuel management and incomplete execution of procedures by the Pilot, by not activating in time the fuel supply from the external tanks (OUTBD) to the internal tanks (INBD) for the feeding of both the engines, causing the fuel in the internal tanks to run out and causing both engines to stop due to fuel starvation.\r\nContributing Factors:\r\n- Poor flight planning on part of the pilot by not considering the amount of minimum fuel needed and not complying with the minimum fuel amount required for domestic flights.\r\n- Loss of situational awareness by the pilot by not following the standard operation procedures.
