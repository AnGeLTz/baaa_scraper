On approach, the airplane became unstable and rolled left and right. Despite the situation, the crew decided to continue the approach to runway 26 when the airplane landed hard. Upon touchdown, the left main gear collapsed. The airplane rolled for about 4,526 feet then veered off runway to the left and came to rest 250 feet further in a grassy area. All four occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Hard landing and subsequent failure of the left main gear after the crew failed to follow approved procedures. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Poorly planned approach, \r\n- Vortex turbulences, \r\n- Fast from LOM to airport, \r\n- Closed gap behind a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar that just landed on same runway.
