During the forced landing, the airplane struck trees and a railing on the deck of the residence, sustaining structural damage to the left wing. The pilot reported that he had the right wing fuel tank selected, and thought the tank was about 1/4 full. He indicated that when the engine lost power, he was too low and didn't have sufficient time or altitude to switch to the belly tank and restore power. Postaccident draining of the fuel tanks disclosed about 18 gallons of fuel in the belly tank, and about one quart in the right wing tank.", "probable_cause": "The pilot's incorrect positioning of the fuel tank selector to a nearly empty tank, which resulted in a loss of engine power due to fuel starvation, and subsequent emergency landing at an off airport site."}
