While approaching the Vestmann Islands, weather deteriorated and the pilot was unable to locate the runway. He took the decision to make a go-around and to follow a holding pattern around the island. Few minutes later, while approaching from the north, the airplane struck the slope of Mt Kervikurkjall located less than 4 km north of the airfield. The airplane was destroyed and all three crew members were killed. It is believed the accident was caused by a loss of control due to sudden downdrafts. \r\nCrew:\r\nEgill Benediktsson,\r\n\u00c1sgeir Einarsson,\r\nFinnur Th. Finnsson.", "probable_cause": null}
