En route to Ganzhda and Yevlakh, the pilot encountered poor visibility due to foggy conditions. He reduced his altitude in an attempt to maintain a visual contact with the ground and followed the railway line. Approaching G\u00f6y\u00e7ay, at a height below 30 metres, he realized he was facing trees so he initiated a sharp turn to the right when the aircraft impacted poplar trees. The right wing was partially torn off and the aircraft crashed. A female passenger was injured while four other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Overconfidence and lack of discipline on part of the captain who decided to continue the flight at a too low and unsafe altitude in poor visibility due to foggy conditions. "}
