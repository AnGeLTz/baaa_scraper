The crew attempted to return when, during the last turn at 115\u00b0, at a speed of 80 knots, the left wing stalled and hit the ground. The aircraft cartwheeled and crashed some 600 metres from the runway end, bursting into flames. The stewardess and seven passengers were killed.\r\nCrew:\r\nClaude H. Seaton, pilot,\r\nMalcolm Wallace, copilot,\r\nLouise Zarr, stewardess. ", "probable_cause": "A stall, induced by a violent yaw, resulting in loss of control from which the pilot was unable to recover. \r\nContributing factors are:\r\nFailure of hold down studs on the number six cylinder of the left engine which resulted in the cylinder being forced off, carrying with it the lower third of the engine ring cowling. Displacement of the remaining portion of the left engine ring cowling, which caused buffeting, as a result of disturbances of the air flow over the tail surfaces, and increased the drag on that side of the aircraft. Severe vibration induced by the continued rotation of the propeller.  Lack of individual propeller pitch controls which would have permitted the pilot to increase the pitch of the propeller on the inoperative engine, thereby reducing the speed of rotation and consequently the vibration from the effect of \"windmilling\".\n"}
