They had intended to leave for home base, RAAF Edinburgh in South Australia, earlier in the day, however the calibration had been delayed due to technical difficulties at Muchea which, being a mobile tracking station, was not as electronically stable as the fixed installations. A65-106 finally departed Pearce off Runway 18 after dusk and in passing rain showers. During initial climb, the airplane crashed few km from the airfield. All four crew members were killed while all three passengers were injured. The aircraft was destroyed. \r\nCrew:\r\nF/O W. J. Bowden, pilot,\r\nF/Sgt P. F. Davis, copilot,\r\nF/O R. G.
