When under the surveillance of Honington Radar, the pilot requested and was granted permission to manoeuvre between flight level (FL)75 and FL60. A few minutes later the aircraft was observed on radar to be flying in a south-easterly direction and shortly thereafter to disappear from the radar picture. At about this time the aircraft was heard to be in a high speed descent and was seen to break up at about 2,500 feet. The main portion of the wreckage burst into flames shortly after impact and the pilot, who was the only occupant, was killed. ", "probable_cause": "It is concluded that the accident was caused by the pilot attempting to recover from a dive whilst flying at a speed considerably in excess of the aircraft's permitted maximum. The excessive speed resulted from his loss of control of the aircraft, most probably following an attempt to perform a prohibited aerobatic manoeuvre. "}
