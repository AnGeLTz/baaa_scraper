Four passengers were killed while 14 other occupants were injured, some seriously. Three people in the house, a nurse and two little girls were uninjured. Fifteen days after the accident, on January 30, the captain died from his injuries.", "probable_cause": "Possible loss of longitudinal control of the aircraft in flight, due to not reaching the minimum climb speed, due to a wrong takeoff configuration as the flaps were retracted (zero position). \r\nThe following contributing factors were identified: \r\n- Inadequate weight distribution that affected the position of the aircraft.\r\n- The CofG was beyond the rear limit, out of the envelope. \r\n- The crew failed to follow the pre-takeoff checklist.\r\n- The total weight of the aircraft was above the MTOW.\r\n- The high density altitude.\r\n- Lack of supervision of the dispatch of the flight by the operator. (Absence of procedures).\r\n- Self-induced pressure from the crew for an expeditious operation."}
