He reported that turbulence was strong thru-out the traffic pattern. Full flaps were lowered on final approach. A strong downdraft was encountered on final approach and power was increased 'to maintain vasi and vref.' Turbulence and a downdraft were reported to be exceptionally strong over the threshold. The pilot stated the aircraft touched down on all three gear, then it pitched up and began to porpoise with increasing amplitude. On the 2nd touchdown, power was applied, but the engine needed 5 to 7 seconds to spool up. The pilot said that after the aircraft porpoise three times, it was in a stall from which it would not recover. Subsequently, it went off the right side of the runway, crossed a parallel taxiway and entered a wooded area before stopping. No mechanical problem of the aircraft was reported that would have resulted in the accident. ", "probable_cause": "Improper in-flight planning/decision by the pilot which resulted in his inability to flare the aircraft and/or recover from a bounced landing. Contributing factors were: crosswind, gusts, turbulence, downdraft, and the pilot's inadequate compensation for wind conditions."}
