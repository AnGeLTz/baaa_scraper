Actual weather conditions were poor with low clouds, rain falls and turbulences. On final, the aircraft was not properly aligned on runway 03R but the crew continued the approach. Too high on the glide, the aircraft landed 750 metres past the runway threshold and after a course of about 2,500 feet, it veered to the left and departed the runway. While contacting taxiway Hotel, the nose gear collapsed and the aircraft came to rest 450 metres further. All 92 occupants evacuated safely and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration on part of the crew who failed to initiate a go-around procedure while the aircraft was not properly aligned on runway 03R during an ILS approach. Poor crew coordination was a contributing factor. "}
