He requested and received vectors for a precautionary landing at an airport short of his destination. During the descent, the oil pressure continued to drop to zero and engine power was lost. He was able to locate the airport underneath the overcast, but loss of engine power prevented him from reaching the runway. The airplane impacted trees 1,200 feet from the airport. The 6 engine cylinder assemblies were changed 7 hours prior to the accident. Examination of the engine and turbochargers did not reveal the source of the oil loss.", "probable_cause": "The loss of engine oil for undetermined reasons and the subsequent engine failure, resulting in a forced landing and collision with trees.
