The weather was reported as indefinite ceiling, zero obscuration, visibility 1/4 mile with fog, wind 120\u00b0 at 5 knots. A number of witnesses heard the aircraft, both before and after takeoff. The consensus of their statements indicated that one engine lost power while the other continued running at a high power setting. An investigation revealed that an intense post crash fire had consumed most of the aircraft. There was evidence that the plane had crashed in a steep nose down, right wing low attitude and did not move after impact. The right propeller was found in a feathered position. The left propeller blades were curled and twisted. Both engines were disassemble, but no evidence of a mechanical failure was found. The gear and flaps were retracted and the cowl flaps were closed. All three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
