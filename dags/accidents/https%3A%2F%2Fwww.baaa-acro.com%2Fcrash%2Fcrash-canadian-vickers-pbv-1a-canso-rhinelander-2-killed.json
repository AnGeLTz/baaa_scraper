Both pilots were killed while three other occupants were seriously injured. The aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Inadequate preflight preparation on part of the crew who failed to obtain/maintain flying speed at takeoff. It was determined that the airplane stalled due to an excessive accumulation of ice on airframe.
