About 10 minutes after takeoff, while in cruising altitude, the captain informed ATC about the failure of the right engine. Because the flight was short (25 minutes in total), he decided to continue to Goi\u00e2nia. Twelve minutes later, the left engine failed as well. The crew declared an emergency and as he was unable to reach Goi\u00e2nia Airport, he attempted an emergency landing in a pasture. The aircraft crash landed 13 km short of runway 14 threshold.
