The captain decided to abandon the takeoff procedure and initiated an emergency braking manoeuvre. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, collided with the ILS antenna, went down an embankment then impacted a brick wall and came to rest 300 metres past the runway end. All 66 occupants were rescued, among them eight passengers were injured. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the crew to follow the published procedures following a fire alarm, as stated in the Operations Manual and the late application of the procedures once the decision to abort the takeoff was taken.\r\nContributing factors:\r\n- Complacency on part of the crew who failed to proceed with a pre-takeoff briefing, \r\n- A fact that influenced the lack of appropriate action from the crew to successfully tackle any emergency,\r\n- Lack of crew resources management, \r\n- The braking coefficient was low because the runway surface was wet.
