The pilot diverted toward Columbia, MO, but before reaching Columbia, both engines lost power. Subsequently, the aircraft crashed about 2 miles east of the airport. An investigation revealed the fuel was contaminated with water. The fuel filter deicing system was operational, but a post-accident examination revealed the deicing tank was empty. This was the 2nd flight since the deice tank had been serviced. The manufacturer's info indicated the supply tank should have provided about 3 to 4 hours of filter deicing operation. One of the pilots was killed. ", "probable_cause": "Inadequate preflight by the pilot(s), water contamination of the fuel, low level of deice fluid (methanol) in the deice tank, and subsequent ice blockage of the fuel filters. Darkness was a related factor.  "}
