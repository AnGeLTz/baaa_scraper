A few minutes later the pilot asked how long the delay would be. He subsequently stated he had the airport, cancelled IFR and was going in VFR. A pilot who had just departed the airport heard a Mitsubishi call 'turning base.' He could not see an aircraft on base for runway 05. He called but did not receive a reply. The aircraft contacted trees along a heading of about 225\u00b0. The flaps were extended about 5\u00b0 and the landing gear were extended. All three occupants were killed.
