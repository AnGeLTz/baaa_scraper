After touchdown on a wet/slushy runway, the pilot realized it was difficult to decelerate properly and decided to make a go-around. This decision was taken too late so the airplane departed far down the runway. After liftoff, the twin engine airplane struck an electric pole and several trees before crashing in a small lake. The pilot was injured and the aircraft was destroyed. ", "probable_cause": "Ice/slush on runway and hydroplaning on wet runway. The following contributing factors were reported:\r\n- Delayed in initiating go-around,\r\n- Unfavorable wind conditions, \r\n- Selected wrong runway relative to existing wind, \r\n- High obstructions, \r\n- No effective braking on roll out, \r\n- Hit poles and trees on go-around, \r\n- Aircraft man-no crosswind limits chart."}
