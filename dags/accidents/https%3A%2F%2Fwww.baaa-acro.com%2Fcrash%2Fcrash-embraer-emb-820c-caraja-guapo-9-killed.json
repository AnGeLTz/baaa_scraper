The aircraft was totally destroyed and all nine occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "At the time of impact, both engines were running at cruise power. On takeoff from Bras\u00edlia Airport, the total weight ot the aircraft was 436 kilos above MTOW, which may contribute to the accident. Nevertheless, investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the accident. Maybe the pilot-in-command made a brutal movement on the control column, causing the aircraft to become uncontrollable following a structural failure of both winglets that were recently installed. "}
