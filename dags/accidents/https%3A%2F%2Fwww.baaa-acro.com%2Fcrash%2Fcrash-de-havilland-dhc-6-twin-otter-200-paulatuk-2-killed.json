On short final, while making a transition from visual to instruments flight rules, the pilot decided to initiate a go-around when the left wing struck the ground. Out of control, the aircraft veered to the left and came to rest. The pilot and a passenger were killed while 10 other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of the combination of the following factors:\r\n- The Paulatuk aerodrome runway is not oriented to correspond with the prevailing winds, \r\n- Environment Canada does not produce an aerodrome forecast for Paulatuk,\r\n- As the aircraft landed, the crosswind from the right increased appreciably reducing visibility in blowing snow,\r\n- During the overshoot, as the pilot was making the transition from visual to instrument flight conditions, control of the aircraft was lost,\r\n- The aircraft was overloaded by 840 lbs."}
