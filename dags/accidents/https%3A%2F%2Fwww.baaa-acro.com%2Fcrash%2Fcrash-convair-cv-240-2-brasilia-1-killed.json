The tower gave it thelatest wind conditions, 330\u00b0, velocity 8-10 kt, and the aircraft was cleared to land. The message was acknowledged. Nothing further was heard from the flight. The tower controller saw a flash of light in the direction from which the aircraft was expected, however, he did not think anything abnormal had occurred. After a few unsuccessful calls, search and rescue services were alerted. The aircraft had struck trees and the ground 8,400 meters from the runway and continued over uneven ground for 300 meters. As the aircraft fell on its side, only the side exit facing upward would be used for evacuation. Because of the failure of normal lights and the fact that no flashlights were available, it was difficult to find the emergency exit. The captain was killed while the copilot was seriously injured.
