On board were three crew members, one instructor and two student pilots. While flying at a very low height, the aircraft struck the water surface and crashed in the Redberry Lake, about 65 km northwest of Saskatoon Airport. The plane was totally submerged and just one of the airmen had managed to swim to a sandbar. Both other pilots remained in the cabin and were killed. The plane was eventually located and brought to shore where it was trucked away for investigation. It is believed that a propeller(s) came in contact with the lake surface. ", "probable_cause": null}
