Due to an excessive temperature of the turbine, the captain decided to shut this engine down (the engine n\u00b02 is equipped with a thrust reverser system). While descending to Aldan Airport, the aircraft approached in a nose down attitude and struck the ground 90 metres short of runway threshold with a positive acceleration of 4 g. On impact, the nose gear collapsed, the aircraft bounced several times then slid for 800 metres before coming to rest on the runway. All 11 occupants evacuated safely while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "The following findings were reported: \r\n- The crew took the wrong decision to fly to Aldan Airport instead of the alternate, \r\n- The approach was continued with excessive gap related to the approach speed and altitude, \r\n- On final, the aircraft was in an excessive nose down attitude,\r\n- The crew failed to identify and correct the wrong approach configuration.
