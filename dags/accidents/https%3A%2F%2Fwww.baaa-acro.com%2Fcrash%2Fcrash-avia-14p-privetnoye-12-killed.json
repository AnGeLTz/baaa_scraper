While cruising in cloudy conditions at the altitude of 950 meters, the airplane hit tree tops, nosed down and crashed in flames in a wooded area located in Privetnoye. The wreckage was spotted on the slope of Mt Kharpuzyany Kayas and all 12 occupants have been killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of ATC errors who failed to monitor the flight properly in reference to approach procedures, and allowed the crew to descent to an insufficient altitude. First, the crew was granted to fly at an altitude of 1,500 meters instead of the minimum 2,100 meters requested. Secondly, the ATC allowed the crew to descend to 400 meters although he knew the aircraft was flying in clouds and above a mountainous area. "}
