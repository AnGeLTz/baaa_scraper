After three minutes, since the aircraft had not reported on base turn, the tower operator called the pilot to check the aircraft's position, but received no reply. Having lost two-way radio contact, the tower gave the alarm, and later learned that the aircraft had crashed. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Commission found chat in the final phase of the intermediate approach leg, the base turn and the beginning of the final approach, the aircraft was flying in cumulonimbus. It was therefore concluded that downward currents had affected the rate of descent to the extent of making the aircraft lose altitude and ultimately crash to the ground. Five crew members and 16 passengers were killed and 5 passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft was destroyed.", "probable_cause": "The accident was due to downdrafts."}
