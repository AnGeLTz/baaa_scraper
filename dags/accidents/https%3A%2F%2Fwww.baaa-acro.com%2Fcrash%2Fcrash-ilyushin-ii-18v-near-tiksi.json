During a polar night approach, the aircraft deviated from the approach pattern and dropped below the glide path relying on a flawed approach scheme. This caused the belly to touch the summit of a snow-covered hill (392 metres high) located 31 km northwest of Tiksi Airport. The aircraft bounced and touched the ground again on the rear slope of the hill some 1,250 metres further on. The fuselage broke into three parts. There was no fire. All 7 crew and 31 passengers were injured, 16 seriously.", "probable_cause": null}
