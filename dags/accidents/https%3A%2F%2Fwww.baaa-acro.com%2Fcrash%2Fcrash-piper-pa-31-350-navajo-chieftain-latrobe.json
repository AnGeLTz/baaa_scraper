At the NDB final approach fix (8.1 miles from the runway), the crew turned inbound and continued to the airport. They contacted the tower and reported over the ILS outer marker (an intermediate point on the NDB final approach, 3.9 miles from the runway). The tower issued the local landing advisories and cleared the aircraft to land. Moments after the copilot advised the captain that they were 15 seconds from the missed approach point, the aircraft collided with trees. Impact occurred 3.8 miles se of the airport at the minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 1,900 feet amsl. An examination of the aircraft records indicated a recurring and current squawk concerning the hsi slaving system. Just before beginning the approach, the Latrobe wind had changed from 230\u00b0 at 4 knots (a headwind) to a strong quartering tailwind. During arrival the crew were advised the wind was from 340\u00b0 at 18 knots. They had figured their timing to the missed approach point by using a ground speed of 120 knots. Earlier that day, the same crew and aircraft had terminated the same NDB approach, 1 mile east of the airport. All seven occupants were injured, five seriously.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with object\r\nPhase of operation: approach - faf/outer marker to threshold (ifr)\r\nFindings\r\n1.
