As the pitch up progressed, the pilot applied right aileron and full right rudder. The aircraft responded by rolling to the right with the nose falling thru. Subsequently, the pilot was able to pull out before the aircraft hit the ground. It collided with a 6 feet wire fence which tore off the engines and caused the aircraft to rotate clockwise on the ground. Cargo in the aircraft was thrown thru the side of the fuselage. The pilot exited the aircraft without injury. The aircraft immediately burst into flames and the fuselage was badly burned. An investigation revealed that 2,989 lbs of freight plus a 359 lb motorcycle were being carried between bulkheads 5 & 11. The bulkhead loads were limited to 450 lbs (5-8) and 300 lbs (8-10). The max gross weight at takeoff was estimated to be 10,310 lbs. The pilot reported that none of the freight was tied down.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of control - in flight\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
