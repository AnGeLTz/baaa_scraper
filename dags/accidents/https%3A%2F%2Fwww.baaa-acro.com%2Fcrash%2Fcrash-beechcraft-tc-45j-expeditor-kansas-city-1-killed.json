During arrival, the pilot reported that he encountered moderate icing at 4,000 feet. He made a localizer-only approach to runway 35. An ATC specialist stated that they saw the aircraft break out of the clouds over the approach end of the runway. At about that time, the pilot transmitted that he was going to enter a left base turn for runway 35 and that he had the runway in sight. He started a turn, and shortly thereafter, the aircraft enter a steep nose down attitude. The aircraft impacted in a railroad yard in a relatively level attitude with the landing gear extended and the wing flaps retracted. However, during impact, it was still descending at a steep angle (estimated approximately 30\u00b0). It was destroyed by impact and ground fire. No preimpact, mechanical failure or malfunction was found. The minimum ceiling and visibility for a straight-in approach were 500 feet and one mile, and for a circling approach, the minimums were 700 feet and one mile. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
