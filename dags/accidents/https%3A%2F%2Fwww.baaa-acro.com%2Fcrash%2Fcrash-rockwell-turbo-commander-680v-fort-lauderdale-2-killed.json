The flight had made 2 high speed taxi operations before takeoff. Immediately after takeoff the flight called to land. The airplane was observed on downwind 200-800 feet agl, 15-25\u00b0 nose high. The airplane then stalled. The compressor surge valves for the left and right engines were found in the open position. Both occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot-in-command's decision to continue takeoff with a known deficiency in the airplane - low power on both engines which resulted from open compressor surge valves. The pilot subsequently failed to maintain airspeed while maneuvering in a turn resulting in an inflight loss of control and a stall/spin."}
