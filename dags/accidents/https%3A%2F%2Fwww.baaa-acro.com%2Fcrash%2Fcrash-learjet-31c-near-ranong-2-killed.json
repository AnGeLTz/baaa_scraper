While descending to Ranong Airport in poor weather conditions, the crew failed to realize his altitude was insufficient when the aircraft struck the slope of a mountain located 48 km south of Ranon. Both pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "For the short flight from Phuket to Ranong the crew were supposed to carry out the approach briefing before takeoff. They failed to do so, which left them little time en route to carry out the procedure and cross-checking the distance and altitude during the flight. The instructor misinterpreted the Ranong DME distance and caused the trainee pilot to descend below minimum sector altitude in unfavourable weather conditions."}
