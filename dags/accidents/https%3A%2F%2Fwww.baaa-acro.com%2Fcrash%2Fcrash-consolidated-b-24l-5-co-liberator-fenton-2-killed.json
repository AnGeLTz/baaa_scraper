The Liberator was out of fuel and losing height rapidly. It was just before midnight and conditions were very hazy and the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Arthur Cambridge, could not see the runway flare path. On his first approach to land, he was too far to the left of the runway. He was advised of this by radio contact with ground control. On his second attempt to land, three of the four fuel pressure gauges dropped to zero and the Liberator swung violently to port. Cambridge ordered the crew to crash positions and with his undercarriage still retracted the Liberator crashed through some trees 3 kilometers from Fenton Airfield and struck the ground in a more or less level attitude. A fire broke out below the flight deck, possibly due to damage to the auxiliary power unit. Two crew members were killed while nine other occupants were rescued. \r\nCrew (24th Squadron):\r\nF/Lt Arthur Aram Cambridge, pilot,\r\nW/O F.
