After touchdown, the crew initiated the braking procedure but the aircraft was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, rolled for about 100 metres then came to rest. All six occupants escaped uninjured. A fire erupted and destroyed the aircraft in few minutes as local firebombers were not sufficiently trained and well equipped. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that following a wrong approach configuration, the crew landed too far down the runway, reducing the landing distance available. Brake marks were found on the last portion of the runway.  "}
