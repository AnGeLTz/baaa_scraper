Upon landing at Valparaiso Airport in good weather conditions, the airplane went out of control, veered off runway, crossed a road and came to rest in a wooded area located along the highway. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and both occupants escaped with minor injuries. ", "probable_cause": "The most likely cause of the accident would have been the loss of control of the aircraft when performing the flare, caused by a loss of lift (stall), because the CofG was beyond the rear limit.\r\nThe following contributing factors were identified: \r\n- The aircraft was unstable on its longitudinal axis because the CofG was too far aft, \r\n- The cargo was not properly secured in the cabin."}
