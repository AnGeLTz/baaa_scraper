Constant altitude consistent with autopilot/autotrim use, particularly in view of reported turbulence/icing. Elevator trim found at approx 13\u00b0 nose up. No evidence found of preimpact failure or malfunction in aircraft powerplants, structure or systems. Evidence suggests scenario of crew inattention after power reduction with autopilot altitude setting. On power application, aircraft pitched up from slow speed into uncontrolled flight.
