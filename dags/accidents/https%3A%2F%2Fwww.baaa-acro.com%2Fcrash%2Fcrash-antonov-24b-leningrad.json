The approach was started by night and below minima-weather conditions. On final approach, the aircraft dropped below the glide path and the captain switched off the ground proximity warning system so the aircraft hit tree tops some 1,700 metres before the inner marker, stalled and crashed in a wooded area located 2,165 metres before the runway threshold. All 5 crew members and 23 of the 39 passengers were injured. The aircraft was destroyed.
