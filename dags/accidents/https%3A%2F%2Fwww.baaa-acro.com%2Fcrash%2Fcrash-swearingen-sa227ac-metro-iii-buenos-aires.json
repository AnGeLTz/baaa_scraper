Before departure, the captain switched off the Stall Alarm System for unknown reasons. Shortly after takeoff from runway 17, the climb gradient was small and landing gear were retracted at a very low altitude. The left wing stalled and struck the runway surface. Out of control, the aircraft impacted ground, slid for few dozen metres, overran the runway and came to rest in a field. Both pilots were uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Loss of control shortly after rotation due to the premature retraction of the landing gear and a takeoff completed with a low climb gradient in the second segment. "}
