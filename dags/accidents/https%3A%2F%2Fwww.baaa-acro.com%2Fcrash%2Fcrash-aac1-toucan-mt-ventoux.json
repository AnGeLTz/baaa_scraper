About one hour and twenty minutes into the flight, the crew encountered poor weather conditions with low visibility due to heavy snow falls. The aircraft hit with its undercarriage the south slope of Mt Ventoux located northeast of Carpentras, and came to rest in 1,5 meter of snow. The crew was slightly injured and rescued a day later while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. It is reported that the aircraft was flying at the altitude of 1,800 meters at the time of the accident (Mt Ventoux is 1,911 meters high) and the pilot was probably following a wrong corridor.
