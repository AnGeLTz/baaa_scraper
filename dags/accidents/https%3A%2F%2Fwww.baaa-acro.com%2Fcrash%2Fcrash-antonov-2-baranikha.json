While approaching Baranikha, weather conditions deteriorated and the visibility dropped to 5 km due to snow falls. While descending to an altitude of 330 meters, the airplane struck a snow covered hill, causing the left ski to be torn off. The airplane continued for dozen yards and eventually nosed down and came to rest in the snow. Both pilots were uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Investigations did no reveal any technical anomalies on the aircraft, the engine or any equipment. It is believed the pilot reduced too much the engine power on approach, causing the airplane to lose speed and height. "}
