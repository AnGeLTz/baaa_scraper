After being cleared to descend to FL200, FL180 and eventually FL95, the crew continued the approach below the minimum descent altitude until the aircraft struck the slope of Mt Vaysi-Karnibaba (2,800 meters high) located about 25,4 km from the airport. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and all six occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, the visibility was limited due to low clouds. ", "probable_cause": "The crew took the decision to continue the descent below the minimum safe altitude over mountainous terrain without any visual contact with ground and various obstacles. Thus, the accident is the consequence of a controlled flight into terrain."}
