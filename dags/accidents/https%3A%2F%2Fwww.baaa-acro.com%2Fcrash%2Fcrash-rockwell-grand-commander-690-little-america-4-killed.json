This was ATC's last communication with the aircraft. At 1030:39, the controller attempted to contact the pilot to advise that he had lost radar contact and to recycle the transponder and squawk 6062. There was no response. Two witnesses reported seeing the aircraft just before it impacted the ground. According to them, they saw fire and/or an explosion before impact and one witness reported the aircraft broke up after it came below an estimated 1,000 to 1,200 feet ceiling. However, the wreckage was scattered over a 2 miles area. An exam revealed evidence of a catastrophic in-flight breakup from overload which included positive overload of both wings. Radar data showed that just before radar contact was lost, the aircraft's speed varied between 221 and 272 knots, heading varied from 072\u00b0 to 014\u00b0 and vertical velocity varied from +300 to -2,400 feet/min. Thunderstorms, turbulences, rain and cloud tops to 25,000 feet were reported. Probable light to moderate icing in clouds above the freezing level of 14,000 feet. Aircraft had weather radar aboard. All four occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight encounter with weather\r\nPhase of operation: cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1. (f) weather condition - clouds\r\n2.
