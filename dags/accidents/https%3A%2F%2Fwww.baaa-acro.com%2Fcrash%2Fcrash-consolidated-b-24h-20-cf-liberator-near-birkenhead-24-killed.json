", "probable_cause": "At the time of the accident, the cloud base was at 1,000 feet with an estimated horizontal visibility up to 7 miles. Investigations were unable to determine the exact cause of the explosion that cause the in flight disintegration of the aircraft. Furthermore, the assumption that the aircraft would have suffered a structural failure was not ruled out. Finally, investigations have been able to determine that no mechanical failure and no fire occurred prior to the final impact."}
