Apparently, this trick had been attempted before by other C-123 crew based in Thailand. During the second attempt the left wing hit a house and the aircraft crashed killing all three crew and two Thai civilians on the ground. Nakhon Phanom Airfield  in north-eastern Thailand, close to the border with Laos, was still under construction when the accident happened. It is possible that the C-123s were bringing in construction equipment or supplies. \r\nCrew (777 TCS, 464 TCW):\r\n1st Lt Raymond E. Doyle, \r\n1st Lt Richard L. Hatlestad, \r\nS/Sgt Stanley E.
