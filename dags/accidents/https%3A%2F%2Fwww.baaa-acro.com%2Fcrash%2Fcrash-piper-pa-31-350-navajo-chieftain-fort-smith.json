The fuel tanks were 'topped' at Laredo, but no fuel was added at Brinkley. During arrival at Fort Smith, the pilot declared an emergency for 'extremely low fuel.' He was cleared for a straight-in approach. Very shortly after that, both engines began running rough with both fuel boost pump lights illuminated.
