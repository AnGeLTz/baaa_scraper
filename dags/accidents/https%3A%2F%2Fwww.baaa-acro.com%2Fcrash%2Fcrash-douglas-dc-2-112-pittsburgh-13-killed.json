All 13 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined by the US Bureau of Air Commerce that ice had built up on its wings and in the slot between the edge of its ailerons and the wing tips, and that the latter condition must have changed the airfoil contour and disrupted the flow of air around the structure, leading to a loss of control. Soon after this accident, improved deicing equipment was announced to help deal with the threat to aircraft caused by the build up of ice."}
