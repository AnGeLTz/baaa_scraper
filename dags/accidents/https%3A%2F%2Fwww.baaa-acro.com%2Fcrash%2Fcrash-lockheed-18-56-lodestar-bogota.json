Several touch and go maneuvers were completed at Flandes Airport and during the last takeoff, the undercarriage failed to retract after the hydraulic system failed. On approach to Bogot\u00e1-El Dorado, the crew was unable to lower the flaps thus a flapless landing was completed on runway 12. After touchdown, the airplane was unable to stop within the remaining distance, overran and came to rest in a drainage ditch. All five occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that a pressure line in the hydraulic system was broken in the right landing gear well, causing a leak of hydraulic fluid. This caused the brakes to be ineffective as well. "}
