Due to an insufficient speed, the airplane climbed with a high angle off attack and was quite immediately in a nose high attitude and in stall conditions. The airplane struck the ground four times then hit power cables before crashing on a truck parking lot. The aircraft was destroyed and all four crew members and four passengers were killed. The rest of the occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong takeoff configuration on part of the flying crew who started the rotation at an insufficient speed, causing the aircraft to be in a high angle of attack and in stall conditions immediately after liftoff. The fact that the runway was soggy was considered as a contributing factor because this slow down the airplane during the takeoff procedure to due an excessive accumulation of water on the lower part of the wing, reducing the aerodynamic capabilities.
