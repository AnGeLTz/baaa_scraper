Shortly later, the crew informed ATC about their ETA in eight minutes. As the pilot has the runway in sight, he was cleared to descend to 600 meters. While cruising at an altitude of 1,020 meters at a speed of 350 km/h in a 7\u00b0 nose-down attitude and a 3\u00b0 left bank, the airplane struck the slope of a mountain (1,081 meters high) located 40 km from the airport. The airplane disintegrated on impact and all 34 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the ground collision was the consequence of a premature descent on part of the pilot-in-command who continued the approach below the minimum safe altitude. The lack of visibility caused by night and the lack of assistance on part of ATC were considered as contributing factors. "}
