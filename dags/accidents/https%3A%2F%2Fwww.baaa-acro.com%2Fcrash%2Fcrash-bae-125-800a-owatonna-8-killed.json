The two pilots and six passengers were killed, and the airplane was destroyed by impact forces. The nonscheduled, domestic passenger flight was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135. An instrument flight rules flight plan had been filed and activated; however, it was canceled before the landing. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.", "probable_cause": "The captain\u2019s decision to attempt a go-around late in the landing roll with insufficient runway remaining. Contributing to the accident were:\r\n- The pilots\u2019 poor crew coordination and lack of cockpit discipline,\r\n- Fatigue, which likely impaired both pilots\u2019 performance, and\r\n- The failure of the Federal Aviation Administration to require crew resource management training and standard operating procedures for Part 135 operators."}
