At 1558LT, the crew reported at 3,600 meters still climbing. Shortly later, while flying at an altitude of 4,000 meters, the propeller blade n\u00b02 separated from the left engine and struck the fuselage, severing elevator and aileron control cables. Control was lost and the airplane entered a dive until it struck the ground in a 45-50\u00b0 nose down attitude and at a estimated speed of 500-550 km/h. The aircraft was totally destroyed and all 55 occupants were killed.
