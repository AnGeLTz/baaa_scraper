The pilot reported that after he feathered the right engine propeller and lowered the gear he noted the aux hydraulic system pressure gage was indicating zero. Post accident inspection disclosed evidence of an oil leak from the left lower section of the right engine. Tests revealed the leak originated from the oil cooler pressure line which failed due to severe corrosion of the wire braid and deformation of the inner cover. Testing of the auxiliary hydraulic pressure pump disclosed the 35 ampere current limiter was blown and 40 amperes were required to drive the pump motor.  The pilot, sole on board, was slightly injured. ", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power (partial) - nonmechanical\r\nPhase of operation: climb - to cruise\r\nFindings\r\n1.
