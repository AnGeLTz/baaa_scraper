The aircraft lost height, struck power lines then collided with the embankment of a railway road and eventually crashed near a wooded area located 2,010 meters short of runway, bursting into flames. The captain was injured while nine other occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It is believed that the dual engine failure was the consequence of an error on part of one of the crew members who inadvertently switched off the electrical systems supplying both engines while trying to deactivate the anti-icing systems. The crew reaction was inappropriate since they took time to identify the failure and failed to feather both propellers. The combination of a late crew reaction with both propellers non feathered (the aircraft was not equipped with an automatic feathering system) increased drag and caused the aircraft to lose height and to crash.
