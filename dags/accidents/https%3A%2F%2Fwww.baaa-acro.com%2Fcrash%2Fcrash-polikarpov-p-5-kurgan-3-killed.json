On final approach to Kurgan Airport, at a height of 200 metres, the pilot initiated a turn to the left when he lost control of the airplane that crashed in the Tobol River, one km from the airfield. The aircraft was destroyed and all three occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the accident was the consequence of the combination of the following factors: \r\n- The aircraft was incorrectly loaded, resulting in a loss of longitudinal controllability;\r\n- The total weight of the aircraft was 300 kilos over the maximum allowable landing weight;\r\n- The engine stopped on approach because the tank to which the fuel selector was connected was empty; \r\n- Lack of knowledge on the part of the crew regarding the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft; \r\n- Poor piloting techniques."}
