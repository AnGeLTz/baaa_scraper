The aircraft then descended to impact with the terrain. Examination of the wreckage revealed the elevator trim actuator rod was extended 2.5 inches which correlates with a full nose down setting. Further examination showed the buss wire for the actuator retract switch was disconnected at the retract switch post. Splattered copper was found on the retract switch indicating the buss wire had been subjected to high amperage. The limitations section of the pilot operating handbook for this aircraft does not state that takeoff is prohibited with inoperative pitch trim. Both occupants were killed.
