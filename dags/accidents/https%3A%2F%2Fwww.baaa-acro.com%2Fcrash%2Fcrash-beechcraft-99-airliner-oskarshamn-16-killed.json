The tail stalled then the aircraft rolled to the left, entered a dive and crashed 150 meters short of runway 19 and 75 meters to the left of its extended centerline. The aircraft was totally destroyed by impact forces and a post crash fire and all 16 occupants were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was probably caused by the fact that the pilot could not compensate for the rapid pitch-up that occurred when the wing flaps were selected out while the engines were running at high power.\r\nThe following contributing factors were reported: \r\n- The aircraft was extremely tail-heavy,\r\n- The crew's training and overall experience on the aircraft type was limited."}
