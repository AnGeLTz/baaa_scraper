The pilot had been observing trucks on the right side of the runway. He stated they could have set it back down except he thought they might swerve into the trucks. He was not specifically looking at the instruments because of the trucks. He took control and the aircraft settled adjacent to the runway and burst into flames.

The plugs were installed in a new engine and the engine obtained takeoff rpm.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: loss of engine power\r\nPhase of operation: takeoff - initial climb\r\nFindings\r\n1.
