The flight plan was filed at FL220 and should take 35 minutes. En route, the crew reported all OK on board when the aircraft disappeared from radar screens. SAR did not find any trace of the aircraft nor the crew who was considered as deceased. In august 2008, an unconfirmed report mentioned that the twin engine aircraft crashed in unknown circumstances near El Pet\u00e9n, Guatemala. It seems that aircraft was stolen and the flight was illegal (drug smuggling flight). Due to circumstances, all hypothesis remains still open. ", "probable_cause": null}
