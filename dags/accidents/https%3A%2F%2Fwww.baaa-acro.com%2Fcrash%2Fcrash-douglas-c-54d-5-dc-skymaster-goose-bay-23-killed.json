", "probable_cause": "It was snowing in Goose Bay when the crew made his technical stop. For unknown reason, the crew failed to request for a deice operation prior to departure and the takeoff procedure was started with 12 mm of snow on both wings and stabs. In such conditions, the aircraft was unable to gain sufficient height after liftoff due to heavy weight, too much drag and loss of lift. "}
