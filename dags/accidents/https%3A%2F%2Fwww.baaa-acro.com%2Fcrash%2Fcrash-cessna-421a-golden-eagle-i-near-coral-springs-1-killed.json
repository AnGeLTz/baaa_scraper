A pilot, with no known flight time in a Cessna 421, flew it to Fort Lauderdale. Except to avoid clouds, he made the flight at a low altitude and airspeed. When asked why, he said he was trying to save the engines. The pilot then departed toward an area of dark clouds and thunderstorms. When he did not arrive at the destination, a search was initiated. The aircraft was found 4 days later where it crashed in a steep nose down attitude. Radar data showed the aircraft made several heading changes and was returning to the dep airport before it crashed. The forward part of the aircraft was buried in a swamp, but the aft edges of the wings, fuselage and empennage were visible above water. The props had rotational damages; no preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction was evident.
