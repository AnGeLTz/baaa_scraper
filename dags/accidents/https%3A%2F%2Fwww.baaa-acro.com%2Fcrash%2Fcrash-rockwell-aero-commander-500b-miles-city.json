The aircraft altimeter was found after the accident set at 30.22 inches of mercury. The visibility was described as 1 and 1/2 miles in snow showers. He continued the approach 'because minimums are one mile.' He descended outbound to 4,500 feet. Minimum procedure turn alt is 4,700 feet msl. The pilot then descended to 3,700 feet msl as he approached the VOR. Power was reduced to 17-18 inches of manifold pressure and airspeed reduced to 120 knots. As the VOR was crossed he glanced at the altimeter and 'the hands were in the two o'clock position.' Landing gear was extended and approach flaps set. The pilot said all seemed normal. He looked out the window and saw 'wispy clouds going by rapidly. Then there were the sounds of impact.' The next thing remembered was the sound of dripping gasoline. The pilot said he crawled out of the cockpit window and wandered 'for a couple hours trying to chase down the searchlights.'", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: in flight collision with terrain/water\r\nPhase of operation: approach - faf/outer marker to threshold (IFR)\r\nFindings\r\n1.
