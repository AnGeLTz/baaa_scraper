Following an uneventful flight, the crew landed on runway 18. After touchdown, the aircraft deviated to the left. It pivoted to the left, lost its left main gear and the left propeller and came to a halt on the runway edge. All 12 occupants were rescued, among them one passenger was slightly injured. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.", "probable_cause": "The accident was the consequence of a lateral runway excursion as a result of a loss of control on the ground caused by the loss of air pressure in the left main gear tire, as a result of the penetration of a FOD (metallic object) into the tire during the landing run. Poor risk management by the San Felipe Aerodrome operator (SKFP) and a lack of a runway FOD control program (SKFP) by the operator of the aerodrome was considered as contributing factors. "}
