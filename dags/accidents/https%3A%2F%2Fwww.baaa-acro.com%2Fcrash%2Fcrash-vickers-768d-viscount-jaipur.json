Due to low visibility, the captain decided to make a go-around. Few minutes later, a second attempt to land was abandoned and a second go-around was completed. During a third attempt to land, the pilot-in-command landed too far down the runway, about 1,800 feet past the runway threshold. Unable to stop on a wet runway and within the remaining distance, the airplane overran, lost its left main gear and came to rest. All 27 occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Wrong approach configuration. "}
