At 1251LT, the pilot cancelled his IFR flight plan and informed ATC he was continuing under VFR mode. This was the last radio contact. As the airplane failed to land at Viracopos Airport, SAR operations were initiated but eventually abandoned 19 days later as no trace of the aircraft nor the 7 occupants was found.
