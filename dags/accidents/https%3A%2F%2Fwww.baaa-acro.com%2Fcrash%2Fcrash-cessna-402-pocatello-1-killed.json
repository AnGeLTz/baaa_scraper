About 2 minutes later, he reported an engine fire and declared an emergency. Approximately one minute thereafter, the right wing separated from the aircraft and the plane crashed. An exam of the wreckage revealed extensive inflight fire damage in the area of separation. A 2.5 by 3 inches hole was found in the right inboard exhaust tube, pn 0850712-6. It was oriented toward the accessory compartment with numerous fuel and oil lines which were fire damaged and charred. Also, much of the engine support structure and wing spar were melted in that area. An exam of the exhaust tube revealed its walls were thin, brittle and discolored in the area of the rupture and several areas of cracks and small holes were found. The exhaust tube had 5,862 hours of total service and 1,762 hours since it was overhauled. Records showed that ad 75-23-08 had been complied with during the last inspection, 25 flight hours prior to the accident. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
