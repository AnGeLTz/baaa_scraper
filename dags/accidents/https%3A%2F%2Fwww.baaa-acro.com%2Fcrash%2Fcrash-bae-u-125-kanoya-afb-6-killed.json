After he complete a counter clockwise arc, the crew started the descent to Kanoya AFB Runway 08R. The visibility was poor due to low clouds. On approach, at an altitude of 3,000 feet, the aircraft entered clouds when the GPWS alarm sounded. Two second later, the crew deactivated the alarm and continued the approach. Ten seconds later, the aircraft impacted trees and crashed on the slope of Mt Takakuma (1,182 metres high) located 10 km north of the airbase. The wreckage was found a day later and all six crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": "Controlled flight into terrain after the crew continued the approach in poor visibility without visual contact with the environment. Misidentification of the environment on part of the crew was a contributing factor, as well as the fact that the crew deactivated the GPWS alarm and failed to initiate corrective maneuver. "}
