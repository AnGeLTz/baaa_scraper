It was purchased new by Yukon Airways and Exploration Company Ltd., owners Andy Cruickshank and Clyde Wann, at the factory in San Diego in 1927. Purchase price was $10,260. A stock version of Charles Lindbergh\u2019s highly modified Ryan, she was touted as the sister ship to the famous Spirit of St. Louis, in which he made his famous transatlantic flight. After only seven months in service, including two forced landings and less than two dozen revenue flights logged, on May 5th, 1928, pilot Tommy Stephens encountered a gusty crosswind while attempting to land in Whitehorse, and crashed the Queen into the company agent\u2019s Model T-Ford, ending her Yukon service career. The pilot and two passengers survived with minor injuries.\n\r\nSource: Yukon News", "probable_cause": null}
