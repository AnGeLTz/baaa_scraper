During the last segment, the level off was completed to high and the airplane struck the ground with its right main gear. Both occupants were uninjured but the aircraft was later considered as damaged beyond repair due to serious structure damages on the right wing. ", "probable_cause": "The instructor had little recent experience on the aircraft type and when demonstrating a landing in turbulent crosswind conditions, he leveled off too high. The right wing dropped and aircraft landed heavily on one wheel while drift was still present. The main spar was damaged and a wing displaced rearwards."}
