On short final, the crew failed to realize his altitude was insufficient when the airplane struck a 30 feet steel light pole located along the Costa Mesa Freeway. Out of control, the airplane dove into the ground and crashed in flames 1,8 mile short of runway 20R threshold. The aircraft was totally destroyed and none of the nine occupants survived the crash.
