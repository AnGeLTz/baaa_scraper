On short final, in a slight nose down attitude, the aircraft struck the ground and crashed 900 metres short of runway 34, bursting into flames. Five passengers were seriously injured while 75 other occupants were killed. At the time of the accident, the crew was completing a VOR/DME approach to runway 34 that was not equipped with an ILS. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the crew established a visual contact with the runway lights when, on short final, due to the presence of local patches of fog, the pilot-in-command lost visual contact with the ground for few seconds. This caused the aircraft to descend below the MDA until it impacted the ground 900 metres short of runway threshold. Poor weather conditions were considered as a contributing factor. "}
