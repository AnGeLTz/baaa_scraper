The aircraft lost height and struck the ground 1,450 metres short of runway. Upon touchdown, it lost its undercarriage, slid for about 640 metres, struck successively the inner marker and a brick house before coming to rest, broken in two. A passenger was killed while 15 other occupants were injured. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of all four engines on final approach due to fuel exhaustion. Poor flight planning on part of the crew. At takeoff, the aircraft weight was 7 tons above the MTOW. The crew deliberately decided to load more cargo and less fuel. Investigations determined that the fuel quantity was insufficient for the planned flight. "}
