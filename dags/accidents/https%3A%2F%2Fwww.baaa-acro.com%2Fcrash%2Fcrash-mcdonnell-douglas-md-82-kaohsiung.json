The crew declared an emergency and was cleared to return. On approach, the aircraft was unstable and too high on the glide. It landed too far down the runway, about 4,000 feet past the runway threshold. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, the aircraft overran, collided with a drainage ditch, lost its undercarriage and eventually came to rest against a concrete wall. All 160 occupants were evacuated, among them four passengers were slightly injured. ", "probable_cause": "The fan cowl on the left engine separated during initial climb. "}
