The captain did not react and continued the approach in such configuration. Once the aircraft passed over the perimeter road, the captain ordered full flaps and throttle down. The engineer then selected full flaps and slowly retarded the power lever when the aircraft lost height, hit tree tops and hit the ground 175 meters short of the runway threshold. It rolled for several yards and hit a ditch before coming to rest. While all 27 occupants were evacuated safely, the aircraft was considered as damaged beyond repair due to severe structural damages. ", "probable_cause": "It was determined that the captain adopted a wrong approach configuration with an insufficient approach speed with full flaps selected, causing the aircraft to stall and hit the ground short of runway threshold.
