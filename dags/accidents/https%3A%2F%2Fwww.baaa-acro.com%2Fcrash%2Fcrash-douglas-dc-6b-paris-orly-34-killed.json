The aircraft disintegrated on impact and debris were scattered for about 200 meters. A passenger was seriously injured while all 34 other occupants, among them the Italian Director Guido Cantelli, were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The Commission was unable to find any malfunctioning of the aircraft or its equipment which would make it possible to determine why the aircraft followed the observed flight path. The Commission, therefore, believes that: \r\n- the aircraft's slight loss of altitude soon after take-off was the main cause of the accident. There is no explanation for this loss of altitude,\r\n- although the regulations in force were observed, the presence of unmarked obstructions in the take-off path constituted an aggravating factor,\r\n- the initial and direct cause of the accident remains unknown.
