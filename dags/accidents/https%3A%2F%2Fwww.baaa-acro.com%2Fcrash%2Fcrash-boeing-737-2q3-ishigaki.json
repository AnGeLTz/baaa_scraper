Following an uneventful flight at an altitude of 24,000 feet, the crew was cleared to descend to 8,000 then 3,000 feet on approach. Runway 22 was in use at Ishigaki Airport with wind from 300\u00b0 at 12 knots and an OAT of 32\u00b0 C. Landing was completed with crosswinds at a speed of 6 knots above Vref. The aircraft bounced and landed a second time. After touchdown, as the spoilers and reversers seems to be inoperative, the crew decided to shut down both engines, making it impossible to use the anti-skid system.  The inner tires on both main gears burst almost simultaneously while at a distance of 125 meters from the runway end. The aircraft skidded to the left, overran and came to rest 145 meters further. All 138 occupants evacuated quickly, among them 49 were injured. Twelve minutes later, one of the engine exploded and caught fire. The airplane was partially destroyed by fire.
