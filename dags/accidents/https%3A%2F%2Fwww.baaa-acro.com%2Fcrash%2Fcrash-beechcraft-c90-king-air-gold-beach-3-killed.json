A fog bank had just rolled into the area and visibility was reduced to approximately one mile with the bases at 200 to 300 feet. The airplane was observed emerging from the fog in a steep left turn and descending rapidly; right of center line, on a one mile final. The left bank angle increased to near 90\u00b0 when the nose dipped down and the airplane collided with a parked vehicle 150 feet right of centerline and 50 feet short of the runway. Unicom not manned. No radio in ambulance on ground. Basic weather data shown from north bend, 60 miles north. All three pilots were killed. ", "probable_cause": "The pilot's failure to initiate a go-around after emerging from a fog bank on a short final which resulted in inadequate airspeed and a stall. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's poor judgement in attempting the vfr approach in imc conditions."}
