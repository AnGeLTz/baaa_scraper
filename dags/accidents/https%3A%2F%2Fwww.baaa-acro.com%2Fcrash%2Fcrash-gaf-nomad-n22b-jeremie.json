Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and a VFR flight plan was filed for the scheduled, domestic, passenger flight. The airplane was substantially damaged and the airline transport-rated captain and first officer, and 12 passengers were not injured. The flight originated about 1405, from the Port-Au-Prince International Airport, Port-Au-Prince, Haiti.", "probable_cause": "The pilot not flying (PNF) captain who was seated in the right seat stated that the approach and touchdown were normal. During the landing roll with both propellers in reverse, the left propeller uncommanded came out of reverse. The airplane veered to the right and the first officer attempted to correct with left rudder and brake while the captain moved the right engine power lever from the reverse position. The airplane continued off the runway and the right wing then collided with trees."}
