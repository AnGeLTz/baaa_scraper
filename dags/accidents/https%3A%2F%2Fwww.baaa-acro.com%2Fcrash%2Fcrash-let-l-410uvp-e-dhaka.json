Few seconds later, the crew was able to restart the right engine but as the temperature of the turbine increased, he shut down the engine again. This time, he was unable to feather the propeller. Due to excessive drag, the aircraft lost height and the captain attempted an emergency landing in an open field. On landing, the aircraft lost its undercarriage and came to rest. All seven occupants escaped uninjured while the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. ", "probable_cause": "Failure of the right engine for unknown reasons.
