When the aircraft failed to arrive at Woodvale or any other station, it was reported missing. Nothing further was heard or seen of the aircraft until the 5th February when a shepherd working on Cornel Min above Llyn Crafnant discovered the wrecked aircraft and the bodies of the four airmen. He reported his find immediately and a team was summoned from the RAF Mountain Rescue Servive at Llandwrog. They arrived the site after dark so postponed any further action until the following day, when they recovered the bodies and identified the aircraft as the Oxford that had been posted as missing a little over 3 weeks earlier.\r\nCrew (418th Squadron):\r\nF/Lt Tommy C.
