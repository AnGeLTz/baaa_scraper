After takeoff, while climbing to a height of 200 feet, the power on the left engine fluctuated. The pilot modified the position of the fuel selector but the situation did not change. As the aircraft was losing height, the pilot shut down the left engine and feathered its propeller when the aircraft rolled to the left, causing the left wing to struck a concrete wall. Out of control, the aircraft struck the roof of a house, then a second one and eventually crashed on a third residence. All three occupants were injured as well as one people on the ground. ", "probable_cause": "The fuel pump and the servo-injectors had faults which certainly contributed to the accident as the left engine was not properly supplied with fuel."}
