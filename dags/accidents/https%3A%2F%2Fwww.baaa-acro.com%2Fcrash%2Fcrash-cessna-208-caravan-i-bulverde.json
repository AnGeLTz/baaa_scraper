The pilot turned back toward the airport, but there was a progressive loss of engine power and the prop went to a feathered position. During an emergency landing at night, the aircraft hit a power line and trees, then crashed. During an engine teardown, disassembly of the reduction gearbox scavenge pump revealed that a retaining nut and tang washer (w/i the scavenge pump) had backed off and lodged between the spur gears, which resulted in a sheared scavenge pump drive shaft. In turn, this resulted in the loss of oil pressure and allowed the prop to feather.", "probable_cause": "Occurrence #1: airframe/component/system failure/malfunction\r\nPhase of operation: cruise - normal\r\nFindings\r\n1.
