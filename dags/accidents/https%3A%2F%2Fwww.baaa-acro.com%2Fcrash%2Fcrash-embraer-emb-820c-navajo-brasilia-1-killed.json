On final approach, in a gear and flaps down configuration, the aircraft suffered an engine failure. The pilot elected to restart the engine when the aircraft deviated from the approach path to the right, lost height and struck a promontory located 61 metres from the runway threshold. Both occupants were seriously injured and the aircraft was damaged beyond repair. 23 days later, the passenger died from his injuries.
