Sixty-seven passengers and five crew members were on board the aircraft. All escaped injury except one passenger who suffered a minor injury. The aircraft was substantially damaged. During the landing made by the captain in an area of thunderstorm activity and heavy rain showers, the aircraft skidded to the right off the runway. It struck a newly constructed taxiway the surface of which was approximately 17 inches above ground level, causing failure of the right main landing gear. The right wing became separated front the aircraft.
