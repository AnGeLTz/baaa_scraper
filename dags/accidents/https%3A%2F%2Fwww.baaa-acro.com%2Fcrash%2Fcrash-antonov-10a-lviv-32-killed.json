A passenger was seriously injured while 32 other occupants were killed. Excessive ice accumulation on stabs caused the airplane to be unstable and to stall. ", "probable_cause": "Investigations were able to determine that the cause of the accident was an excessive deployment of flaps during an approach completed in icing conditions. The combination of icing conditions (excessive ice accumulation on stabs) and excessive flaps deployment caused the aircraft to stall. Following this accident, Antonov will provide an update of the flight manuals with a modification of the approach procedures, limiting the flaps deployment to an angle of 15\u00b0 in icing conditions. Investigations conducted about this accident will be able to determine the cause of a similar accident that occurred at Lviv Airport on 16NOV1959, causing the crash of the same type of aircraft in identical conditions.
