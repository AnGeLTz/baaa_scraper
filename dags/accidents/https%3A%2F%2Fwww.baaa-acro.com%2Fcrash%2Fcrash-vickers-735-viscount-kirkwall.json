The aircraft bounced and about three seconds later it touched down again on its starboard wheels, striking the runway for the second time to the left of the centre line with n\u00b04 propeller. The commander then called for full power, not knowing that the aircraft was damaged, the copilot however, did not apply any power because he was aware that damage has been sustained. The aircraft diverged to the right, it left the runway then ran parallel along the grass until it crossed the intersecting runway paving where the nose landing gear collapsed. The aircraft came to rest on water-logged grass near the right hand edge of runway 25 and the commander ordered an evacuation which was carried out without injury. There was no fire and the airport fire and rescue services arrived promptly. ", "probable_cause": "The accident was caused by the commander failing to take overshoot action at an early stage in the approach to land when it became apparent that the approach was unstabilised and the windscreen wiper was unserviceable.
