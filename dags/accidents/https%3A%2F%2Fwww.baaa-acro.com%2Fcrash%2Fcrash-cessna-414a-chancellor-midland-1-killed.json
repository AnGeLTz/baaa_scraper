The previous pilot stated that he normally pulled the ac circuit breaker after landing, that the breaker supplied voltage to the pilot's attitude indicator, and that he told the new pilot of this procedure which was not on the aircraft's checklist. This was the new pilot's first instrument flight in this aircraft. The accident occurred in a residential area.
