The hydraulic system failed so the undercarriage must be lowered manually. The captain decided to perform a low pass over the runway to check the landing gear with ATC. That made, the crew completed a nose high and flapless landing shortly later. After touchdown just over the threshold, the crew activated the reverse thrust systems when the airplane became airborne. So the throttles were closed and the aircraft landed again but too far down the runway. Unable to stop within the remaining distance, it overran, struck a concrete pylon and several obstacles before coming to rest in flames in a popular area. Ten passengers and 24 people on the ground were killed. The aircraft was destroyed by a post crash fire.", "probable_cause": "It was determined that a bomb placed in the front left lavatory exploded in flight, causing a 1,5 m hole in the fuselage and damaging the hydraulic lines.
