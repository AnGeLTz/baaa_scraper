En route, while in cruising altitude, the crew simulated a failure of the left engine and gave maximum right rudder, leading to an aerodynamic overbalancing and resulting to a side-slip (it was impossible to return the rudder to the neutral position in this situation). The aircraft went out of control, entered a dive and crashed in a snow-covered swampy bush land located near the village of Penyok, some 91 km of the Novosibirsk-Tolmachevo Airport. All six crew members were killed. ", "probable_cause": null}
