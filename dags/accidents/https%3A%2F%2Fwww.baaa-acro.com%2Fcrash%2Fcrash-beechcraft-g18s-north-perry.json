At that time, he noticed that the left engine rpm was decaying. There was insufficient runway remaining to abort, so he elected to feather the left engine and continue the takeoff. The left prop stopped rotating before it feathered. With additional drag from the left prop, the aircraft would not climb or maintain level flight. The pilot was able to fly the aircraft over buildings and other obstacles (up to 75 feet tall) near the airport boundary. Just beyond these obstacles, the aircraft struck trees and crashed in a wooded area. There was a small post-impact fire near the accessory section of the right engine. An exam and teardown of the left engine revealed that an impeller shaft bearing, Pratt & Whitney part number 288943, had failed and allowed the impeller to rub against the diffuser. No other preimpact failures were found. The pilot, sole on board, was slightly injured.
