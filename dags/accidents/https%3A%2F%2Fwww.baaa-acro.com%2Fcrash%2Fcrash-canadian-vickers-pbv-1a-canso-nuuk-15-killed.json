This was contrary to current safety rules. Both pilots considered the touchdown was normal. However, after a run of a few seconds the aircraft swerved abruptly to starboard assuming an increasingly nose-down attitude. A steadily progressing but very quick deceleration took place. The seaplane plunged into water and came to rest, partially submerged. While all three crew members and three passengers were rescued, 15 passengers were drowned. ", "probable_cause": "As a result of the technical investigation, it was considered most probable that, because of a mechanical malfunctioning the nose wheel doors were not closed and locked and that there was an aperture of 70 mm when the landing took place. The gaping doors were torn off when the aircraft having landed at rather high speed sank deeply into the water. The extremely great water pressure in the nose wheel well forced the aft bulkhead of the well inwards resulting in severe damage to the front cabin."}
