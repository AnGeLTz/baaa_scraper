At the time of the accident, runway 29 threshold was displaced by 900 metres, reducing the landing distance available from 3,000 metres to 2,100 metres due to construction works. Following a wrong approach configuration, the aircraft landed too far down a wet runway and was unable to stop within the remaining distance. It overran, lost its undercarriage and came to rest 60 metres further with the right partially torn off. 11 passengers were injured while 79 other occupants were unhurt.", "probable_cause": null}
