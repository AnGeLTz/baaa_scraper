On final approach by night, the crew encountered technical problems with the engines. Apparently due to low speed, the airplane stalled when four crew members managed to bail out. The aircraft crashed in an open field located eight miles from the airbase and was destroyed. Two crew members were rescued while four others were killed. The pilot ejected but was hit by a falling hatch after ejection and fatally injured. Sgt Blazina bailed out low and hit the ground before his chute opened.\r\nThose killed were:\r\nLt Col Poole,\r\nMaj McGuirk,\r\nSgt Cole,\r\nSgt Blazina.

Also, it is believed the approach speed was low at that time, causing the aircraft to stall. "}
