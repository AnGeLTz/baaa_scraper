There were no witnesses to the crash; however, several local residents heard the airplane overfly their homes at a low altitude. One resident stated that he heard the airplane collide with the trees. Another resident stated that he heard the engine operating as the airplane flew low overhead. Both residents reported that reduced visibility hampered their ability to find the wreckage. One resident estimated that the visibility was about 50 to 60 feet. The prescribed takeoff minimums for that airport is 300 feet and 1 mile visibility. Examination of the airplane did not disclose evidence of mechanical malfunction. The pilot, sole on board, was killed.
